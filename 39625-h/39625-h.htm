1</span>LLANGOLLEN<br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND</span><br />
ITS VICINITY.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here let me still with simple Nature
live,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My lowly field-flowers on her altar lay;<br />
Enjoy the blessings that she meant to give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And calmly pass my inoffensive day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The attraction of North Wales, by its romantic scenery, the
antiquity of its language, and the well authenticated records of
its desperate struggle for independence, renders every part of
the Principality interesting, and perhaps none more so than the
beautifully picturesque town and neighbourhood of Llangollen,
which have deservedly excited the attention and admiration of a
vast number of strangers and antiquarians.&nbsp; Nor have the
expectations of its numerous visitors been disappointed; for,
though the Alps may raise their towering summits to a greater
height&mdash;may embosom in their dark recesses more ample lakes,
and give rise to more magnificent rivers&mdash;yet even they
cannot present a more pleasing variety of scenery, or more
picturesque views, than those with which Llangollen is
surrounded.</p>
<p>This small market town is on the border of North Wales, and is
situated in that part of the county of <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Denbigh which adjoins
Shropshire.&nbsp; It is on the south <a name="citation2a"></a><a
href="#footnote2a" class="citation">[2a]</a> bank of the river
Dee, and the mail road from London to Holyhead passes through the
town.&nbsp; The distance from London to Llangollen is about one
hundred and ninety miles, and from the latter place to Holyhead
seventy-seven miles.</p>
<p>The town consists of one long badly paved street, and a short
cross one, together with some courts and alleys, called squares,
but which at present ill deserve an appellation generally
conveying to the mind an idea of neatness, if not of superiority,
as they are for the most part formed with obscure mean-looking
houses, built of the dark-coloured silicious stone procured from
the rocky bed of the river, and from the surrounding hills.&nbsp;
The houses are seldom more than two stories high, and have a very
sombre appearance, except where the owners have had the good
taste to avail themselves of the lime which is near at hand, in
rough-casting or plastering the fronts.&nbsp; The difference of
the appearance of the buildings thus finished is so advantageous
that it is to be hoped the plan will be generally adopted. <a
name="citation2b"></a><a href="#footnote2b"
class="citation">[2b]</a></p>
<p>Increase of population has here the effect which is usually
attributed to it, viz. a manifest improvement in the town.&nbsp;
The last census states the number of houses at 289, and of the
population at 1287; but the inhabitants <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>may at this time (A.D. 1827) be fairly
estimated at 1500, and habitations in proportion. <a
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a>&nbsp; Among the newly-erected houses
are some very neat buildings, at which private lodgings may be
obtained, with every requisite accommodation.</p>
<p>Llangollen has a market on Saturday, and five <a
name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b"
class="citation">[3b]</a> fairs in the year, viz. on the last
Friday in January, the 17th of March, the 31st of May, the 21st
of August, and on the 22nd of November; at which, horses, horned
cattle, pigs, butter, cheese, &amp;c. are sold.&nbsp; A market
house once stood where the Hand Gardens now are, and is a
convenience much wanted.&nbsp; Besides the London Mail to
Holyhead, which passes through Llangollen every afternoon at five
o&rsquo;clock, <a name="citation3c"></a><a href="#footnote3c"
class="citation">[3c]</a>; and leaves the letter bags, which it
takes up again about eight o&rsquo;clock every morning, there are
regular stage coaches passing to and from London and Holyhead
every day.&nbsp; Light vans, for the conveyance of luggage,
&amp;c. pass twice a week from Salop. <a name="citation3d"></a><a
href="#footnote3d" class="citation">[3d]</a>&nbsp; There are also
waggon conveyances, through Wrexham, to Chester; <a
name="citation3e"></a><a href="#footnote3e"
class="citation">[3e]</a> and boats on a collateral branch of the
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Ellesmere
Canal, which start at stated periods for Liverpool, &amp;c.</p>
<p>There are twelve <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a> licensed inns and public houses in this
little town, all of them very respectable; and whether it is
owing to superior management, or to the excellence of the water,
which is the most pure imaginable, and flows abundantly in every
part of the town, the ale brewed in Llangollen is in great and
deserved repute all over the kingdom.</p>
<p>Two principal inns and hotels adorn the town&mdash;the Hand
inn, which is in the centre, near the church; and the
King&rsquo;s Head, at the west end, near the bridge.&nbsp; The
excellent accommodations afforded in both of them are not
surpassed; they are under the best regulations, and abound with
elegance and convenience.&nbsp; Post carriages and horses are
kept at both houses, and the harp resounds in their halls.&nbsp;
The Viceroys of the sister kingdom, as well as the nobility, seem
to regard Llangollen as a favourite resting-place, in passing
from one country to the other.</p>
<p>Mountains and hills enclose the town on every side.&nbsp; On
the south, the Berwyn Mountains raise their lofty heads.&nbsp; On
the north, Castell Dinas Bran, vulgarly called Crow Castle,
seated on its conical summit, frowns over the town in ruined
grandeur, and is backed with the vast and wonderful range of
lime-stone, which forms a ridge stratum super stratum, and called
the Eglwyseg <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Rocks.&nbsp; A portion of these rocks, with the little
tumulus-like hill of Pen y Coed, forms the eastern barrier.&nbsp;
On the west, the lofty Gerant, <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a> or Moel y Barbwr, with
the Bwlch Coed Herddyn, and other distant mountains, close the
scene.</p>
<p>The sacred Dee, which here foams along its rocky bed, is
crossed by a stone bridge at the western extremity of the town;
the church stands in the centre; and at the east end is Plas
Newydd, the residence of the two highly respected ladies whom
Miss Seward has recorded in song.</p>
<p>Having thus given a brief sketch of Llangollen, embosomed as
it is in a vale where all the beauties of nature seem to
concentre, I shall proceed to retrace and fill up the outline of
the picture, by classing under the name of each remarkable place
its description, and the particulars of its history, quoting from
and referring to authorities as I proceed; but as, from the
varied scenery and the romantic views with which this
neighbourhood abounds, an attempt to do justice to its several
beauties would be vain, I shall abstain from endeavouring fully
to describe what requires a more nervous hand than mine to paint;
leaving to the reader&rsquo;s taste full scope to select the
scenes most congenial to his disposition, assuring him, that
whether the dreary waste, over whose vast plains sterility <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and barrenness
hold eternal sway; or the luxuriance of verdant meads and shady
groves&mdash;the sombre haunts of secluded retirement; or the
soul-inspiring gaiety of nature in her most lightsome
mood&mdash;be most in unison with his frame of mind, here may be
found solace for the melancholy, amusement for the gay, exercise
for the naturalist, and food for the antiquarian and
philosopher.</p>
<p>As a commencement of my proposed tour, I shall now beg my
reader to accompany me on the north side of the Dee, to Clawdd
Offa, or Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, the ancient boundary of this part of
the Principality.</p>
<h3>CLAWDD OFFA.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The best concerted schemes men lay for
fame<br />
Die fast away.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;O lamentable sight! at once<br />
The labours of whole ages lumber down,<br />
A hideous and misshapen mass of ruin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Offa was the eleventh King of Mercia, and succeeded Ethelbald,
A.D. 757.&nbsp; He was born deaf, lame, and blind.&nbsp; About
the year 776, <a name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a> he caused a deep ditch and rampire to
be made across the country, to curb the incursions of the Welch,
beginning at the waters of the Dee, at Basingwerke Abbey, in
Flintshire, to the river Wye, in Herefordshire; <a
name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a> or, as some say, to <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the Severn
sea.&nbsp; Like the famous wall of China, it is carried over
rivers, rocks, valleys, and mountains, and extends nearly one
hundred miles. <a name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a>&nbsp; I intend to commence my excursion
with this ancient Dyke, and pursue it as far as is consistent
with my plan.&nbsp; It runs through the parish of Ruabon, which
is on the west side.</p>
<h3>RUABON, OR RHIWABON,</h3>
<p>Is a neat pleasant village, about six miles east of
Llangollen.&nbsp; It is surrounded by mines of coal, ironstone,
&amp;c. with which the neighbourhood abounds.&nbsp; One of the
recently formed joint stock companies, denominated the British
Iron Company, is said to have expended on two works in this
neighbourhood &pound;134,952. <a name="citation7b"></a><a
href="#footnote7b" class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; There are also
other large ironworks, &amp;c. within about two miles of the
town.</p>
<p>The church is dedicated to St. Mary, and is a very respectable
ancient structure.&nbsp; It has an excellent organ, and a pretty
font of white marble, both given by the late Sir W. W. Wynn,
Bart. who has left behind him a character for beneficence that
has been rarely if ever equalled.&nbsp; This is the burial-place
of the highly respected family of Wynnstay; and in the church are
some ancient monumental remembrances, as well as some more
recently erected ones, of Sir W. W. Wynn&rsquo;s ancestors, well
worthy inspection.&nbsp; Dr. Powel, from whose <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>celebrated
translation of the Chronicle of Caradoc of Llancarvan I have
obtained much information, was Vicar of Ruabon in 1571, and was
buried here.&nbsp; The monumental records of Sir W. W.
Wynn&rsquo;s family are highly panegyrical; but I cannot in this
small work give copies of the epitaphs, and to record the good
deeds of this excellent family would fill a folio.</p>
<p>Adjoining the town of Ruabon, a road passes into the park, and
to the mansion, of</p>
<h3>WYNNSTAY.</h3>
<p>The hereditary estate of the ancient and honourable family of
Sir Watkyn Williams Wynn, Bart.&nbsp; A porter resides at a small
house on the left side of the entrance to the park, who admits
all strangers requesting it.&nbsp; A beautiful road leads to the
mansion, and large herds of deer exhibit their graceful forms and
agility among the surrounding trees.&nbsp; Offa&rsquo;s Dyke runs
through the grounds, which are of very great extent, well wooded,
tastefully laid out, and kept in nice order.&nbsp; The house is
very extensive, and the stables also capacious.&nbsp; The
premises have acquired their present magnitude by various
additions made at different times by the possessors.</p>
<p>In the eleventh century it was the residence of Madog Gryffydd
Mailor, <a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a> Lord of Bromfield, and of Dinas Bran,
near Llangollen.&nbsp; It was then called Wattstay, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>from another
old dyke still visible, named Watt&rsquo;s Dyke; and the space
between that and Offa&rsquo;s Dyke was a sort of neutral
territory, on which the Welch and Saxons used to traffic with
each other. <a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a>&nbsp; When the noble family of the
Wynns became its possessors, the original name was changed to
Wynnstay.&nbsp; The house is replete with elegance and
convenience, and is the seat of hospitality as unbounded as the
benevolence of its owner&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Under the auspices
of the late and present noble possessors, both the edifice and
grounds have nearly attained the ne plus ultra of perfection; yet
at this time a vast addition is making to the magnitude of the
park, by changing the direction of the road to Oswestry.&nbsp; In
short, Wynnstay is one of the most beautiful seats, not only in
Wales, but even in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the park stands a fluted freestone column, erected to the
memory of the late Sir W. W. Wynn, Bart. by his mother, who
survived him.&nbsp; The elevation, after a design by Wyatt, is
about one hundred feet, and is surmounted by a bronze urn.&nbsp;
The base also is of bronze, decorated with eagles and oak leaves,
and bears this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Filio optimo, mater, eheu!
superstes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A surviving mother, alas! to the best of
sons.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A spiral staircase runs within the pillar to the top, from
whence is a fine view of the park and grounds.</p>
<p>There are other recently erected decorative buildings <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>on the
domain; one of which, called Waterloo Tower, and built to
commemorate the glorious victory obtained at Waterloo by the Duke
of Wellington, commands a very extensive prospect; on it a flag
is always displayed when Sir Watkyn is at Wynnstay.&nbsp; Another
tower is built on a most beautiful spot on the bank of the Dee,
called Nant y Bellan, i.e. the Dale of the Martin; and was
erected, as I learn from the Oration in the Ellesmere Report, p.
24, to the memory of those ancient Britons who fell in quelling a
dangerous rebellion in a neighbouring island, now more closely
united to us.&nbsp; Near this place a boat is kept for the
purpose of crossing the river.</p>
<p>From the old house a road is continued on the rampire of
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke for nearly two miles, and bears the whimsical
title of Llwybr y Gath, i.e. Cat&rsquo;s Path, although it is
wide enough for two carriages to pass abreast.&nbsp; The ardent
and inquisitive traveller will find in the interesting domain of
Wynnstay much to examine, much to amuse, and much to admire.</p>
<p>Returning through the park to the high road, I crossed the Dee
over a recently erected iron bridge; and entering the parish of
Chirk, I soon regained Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, the peculiar features
of which plainly distinguish it.&nbsp; The Dyke crosses the road
to London about two hundred yards to the west of
Whitehurst&rsquo;s new toll gate, and about four miles and a half
from Llangollen.&nbsp; Pursuing the line of the Dyke towards
Chirk Castle, I found in it a <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>number of large and long grey stones,
mossed over, and lying confusedly at the bottom.&nbsp; They are
very remarkable, as there are no quarries in the neighbourhood,
from which such stones could be procured; and as they all lay in
one spot, I conjecture that they have been used to mark the
graves of the slain in the year 1165, when Henry II. made his
first expedition against North Wales, by way of the Berwyn
Mountains:&mdash;&ldquo;He assembled a large army at Oswelt Tree,
and detached a number of men to try the passes into Wales.&nbsp;
There was a narrow way through the Dyke, near Castell Crogen, now
Chirk Castle; they were set upon by a party of Welchmen, as they
would have passed this strait, and many of them were there slain,
and buried in that ditch; where (says my Author) their graves are
now (i.e. 1697) to be seen.&rdquo; <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>The place was called Adwy&rsquo;r Beddau, i.e. Pass of the
Graves.&nbsp; There is a field or two near the place still called
Tir y Beddau, i.e. Land, or Field of the Dead.&nbsp; I visited
this place, and found the field under cultivation; and it is
possible that the stones may have been removed out of the way of
the plough, to the place where they now lie.&nbsp; On examining
an old survey of Chirk Lordship, I found two or three parcels of
land lying contiguous to each other, and on each side of the
Dyke, at this place, bearing the same name, Tir y Beddau.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>From
this field of the dead I bent my way along the Dyke, through
bramble, bush, and brier, to the no small disturbance of its
numerous inhabitants, the nimble squirrels, the rabbits, and the
pheasants, springing before me every thirty or forty yards.&nbsp;
At length I arrived at the brink of a sheet of water called the
pool, on which numbers of wild ducks, coots, and other aquatic
birds were disporting.&nbsp; The ditch and rampire continued
through the middle of that pool, and the rampire is still
traceable from the boat house on the opposite side; and running
along the ley in front of Chirk Castle to a wood yard on the west
side of it, it again deepens, and assumes its form.&nbsp; As it
approaches the Ceiriog river, which skirts the south side of the
park, it appears indeed a barrier.&nbsp; I took the depth a
little from the farm or wood yard, and found it about fifty feet,
a little farther on sixty feet, and near its termination at Pont
Melin y Castell, or the Castle Mill, it is about eighty
feet.&nbsp; At this point there is a bridge over the river, up
whose banks, at about half a mile distance, is a farm still
retaining the name of Crogen Isaf, or Lower Crogen.</p>
<p>In the bank of limestone rock below the bridge, and on the
side of the river, is a cavern or subterraneous passage, of
unknown extent, and which I have not had opportunity to
explore.&nbsp; About Crogen Isaf, and near a bridge of very
capacious span across the Ceiriog, called Pont Madoc, a powder
mill was about to be erected; but when the work was nearly
completed, the projector <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>became unable to proceed, and it was
discontinued.</p>
<p>Thinking it best not to break the narrative of my progress
along the ancient Dyke, by which I passed so near to the
venerable Castle of Chirk, I have hitherto purposely omitted an
account of that celebrated mansion.&nbsp; I shall now, however,
return to it.</p>
<h3>CHIRK CASTLE.</h3>
<p>This noble and ancient pile was built on the site of Castell
Crogen, about the year 1011.&nbsp; I must here hazard a
conjecture concerning this Castle.&nbsp; I am of opinion that the
old Castle of Crogen was then enlarged and repaired, not entirely
rebuilt; as John Myddleton, who communicated a paper to the
Society of Antiquarians on the subject, says it was begun A.D.
1011, and was finished in 1013, which makes it only about two
years, probably too short a period for the total re-erection of
so large an edifice.</p>
<p>The building is square, and is flanked by four massive
bastions or rounders, one at each corner.&nbsp; There is a fifth
in the centre of the front, of the same dimensions as the
others.&nbsp; The length of the front is about two hundred and
fifty feet; the square court or quadrangle within the walls is
about one hundred and sixty-five feet, by one hundred.&nbsp; The
grand entrance is under a lofty arched gateway; the side entrance
is by a double flight of stone stairs, through a postern and
colonnade, into the quadrangle.&nbsp; I measured the walls of the
north-west <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>bastion, and found them more than fourteen feet thick,
and all apparently of solid masonry.&nbsp; The whole of this
extensive and ponderous building is of hewn stone.</p>
<p>On the west side of the quadrangle is the door of the dungeon,
which in feudal times has been the melancholy abode of many
hapless victims, who fell under their Lord&rsquo;s
displeasure.&nbsp; There is at the entrance a case or hollow in
the thickness of the wall, for a portcullis; and there are two
places of confinement, one below the other.&nbsp; The first is
not formed so far below the surface of the earth as totally to
exclude the light of day; it being admitted obliquely from
above.&nbsp; There is also a fire-place; so that it is probable
this might be a prison for less serious crimes, or for
delinquents of noble quality.&nbsp; The deep dungeon is far below
the first, the descent to it being by forty-two steps; and is
said to be as deep as the walls are high.&nbsp; It is small and
circular, and about twelve or fourteen yards in
circumference.&nbsp; The iron doors are now taken away, and one
of oak is substituted, which bears upon it numberless notches,
not, like those of Sterne&rsquo;s captive, made to mark the days
of misery, but the number of horns of strong ale drank at one
sitting by a party assembled in this place to drink to the health
of the Lord of the Castle.&nbsp; It is a record of the strength
of their heads, if not of their attachment to their Lord.&nbsp;
High up in the wall are two iron hooks, fixed to support a large
cheese, which was formerly kept here for the entertainment of
those who choose to visit this gloomy <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>place.&nbsp; The sides of the dungeon
are partly formed of the rock on which the Castle is founded, as
is also the floor.</p>
<p>Returning to the light of the sun, on the adjoining south side
of the quadrangle is the servants&rsquo; hall, in which are
deposited various ancient and family relics.&nbsp; The walls are
hung round with boar spears, pikes, and halberts; arquebuses,
matchlocks, and other old fire-arms; saddles, spurs, and various
pieces of armour; enormous and curious spoils of the chace,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Among a variety of deer antlers, is the head of a stag, of
which the following curious story is told:&mdash;A young woman,
crossing the Black Park at the early dawn of morning, was
assailed by this furious animal.&nbsp; Her cries for assistance
were heard by one of the numerous retainers of the Castle, whose
dwelling was nigh, and he promptly ran to her aid.&nbsp; The
stag, no way intimidated, made fiercely at the man, and gored him
to death.&nbsp; The Black Park is now converted into a
colliery.</p>
<p>Opposite to the servants&rsquo; hall is the main entrance into
the Castle from the quadrangle.&nbsp; In the large and lofty
entrance hall are some fine paintings, and a superb billiard
table.&nbsp; The grand stairs front the entrance, and lead to the
stately apartments of the Castle, which have been lately
renovated in a superior style of elegance by Mrs. Biddulph, <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> the present inheritor.&nbsp; A saloon,
a gallery, and a drawing-room, in particular, are beautifully
finished, and banish from the mind the idea of a <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>gloomy
Castle, which its exterior seems to promise.</p>
<p>The rooms are enriched with some good paintings; and in the
saloon are some finely executed portraits of the family.&nbsp; In
this room there is a cabinet of most exquisite workmanship.&nbsp;
The views from the different windows are inexpressibly beautiful,
and are said to embrace a prospect extending into seventeen
counties.</p>
<p>In the civil wars this Castle was besieged by Cromwell&rsquo;s
adherents, and one of its sides, with three of its towers,
overthrown.&nbsp; It is mentioned as a prodigious exertion of
labour, and in which no cost was spared, that the wing was
rebuilt in one year, at the expense of eighty thousand pounds;
which I think strengthens my idea of the present Castle being
only an enlargement and repair of the more ancient Castell
Crogen.</p>
<p>About a mile and a half from the Castle stands the pleasant
little village of</p>
<h3>CHIRK.</h3>
<p>It is an example of simple neatness and good taste.&nbsp; The
cottages are built in the Swiss style, with singular rustic
elegance, and have the appearance of comfort and quiet.&nbsp; The
inhabitants are mainly indebted for the beauty of their rustic
cottages to the Countess Dungannon of Brynkinallt, and for the
uniformity and useful convenience of water in every house, which
is conveyed by leaden pipes, to the exertions and influence of
Mrs. Myddelton Biddulph, the owner of the Castle, and the <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>elder branch
of the much-respected family of the Myddeltons.&nbsp; She is Lady
of the Manor of Chirk, and has built and endowed a school for the
education of the village children.&nbsp; Her exertions to promote
the comfort and interest of her tenantry are worthy
imitation.</p>
<p>Near the church, and now enclosed in a garden, stands an
artificial mount, which Mr. Pennant conjectures to be coeval with
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke. <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; A similar one stood on the
opposite side, where now the road runs.&nbsp; These mounts were
probably Saxon stations, and curbs to the Welch, to prevent them
from violating the line of demarcation which Offa had formed.</p>
<p>The church is a capacious old structure, dedicated to St.
Mary, and was formerly an impropriation belonging to the Abbey of
Valle Crucis.&nbsp; It has a tower steeple, containing six
bells.&nbsp; All the east side of the church wall within is
nearly covered with marble monuments of the Chirk Castle
family.&nbsp; A bust of Sir Thomas Myddelton, and another of his
Lady, are well executed.&nbsp; There are also many other
remarkable <i>memento mori&rsquo;s</i> within the church, well
worth the attention of those who love to muse on</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Names once famed, now dubious or forgot,<br
/>
And buried midst the wreck of things which were.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe there are not standing within the same compass of
ground in the kingdom of Great Britain, three <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>mansions so
eminently deserving admiration for magnificence, grandeur, and
beauty, as Wynnstay, Chirk Castle, and Brynkinallt; the latter of
which I shall now proceed to describe.</p>
<h3>BRYNKINALLT</h3>
<p>Is about one mile from the village of Chirk, and is the
ancient seat of the noble family of the Trevors, as I find in an
authentic genealogical table, of which the following is a short
extract:&mdash;&ldquo;In the reign of King Richard II. there was
a noble peer, by name Geofry Lord Trevor, and also John Trevor,
Bishop of St. Asaph, and Chancellor of Chester.&nbsp; He
continued in the bishoprick to the sixth year of King Henry
IV.&nbsp; And in the reign of King Henry VI. (1421) lived two
brothers descended of this honourable family, namely, John and
Richard.&nbsp; John, the eldest brother, was seated at
Brynkinallt.&nbsp; He married Agnes, daughter and heiress of
Peter Chambre, of Pool, Esq. by whom he had issue five sons, who
laid the foundation of many noble branches.&nbsp; Robert, the
eldest, succeeded his father at Brynkinallt.&nbsp; He married
Catherine, daughter and heiress of Llewellen Ap Howel De Mould,
and had issue.&nbsp; From Edward, the second son, by Amy,
daughter of James Ryffin, Esq. descended Mark Trevor, from whom
descended the Viscount Dungannon in Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; From
him the nobleman who at present inherits the title, and the
residence of Brynkinallt, is a lineal descendant; and under his
auspices, aided <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>by the exquisite taste of his Countess, this superb
edifice has attained the acme of beauty.</p>
<p>To rush at once into this charming labyrinth of delight would
fill the mind with confusion; and the beholder would be at a loss
in what direction to commence his observations, where every part
claims his admiration.&nbsp; I therefore beg my readers will
accompany me about two miles on the Oswestry road, to Bryn y
Gwyla Lodge, a beautiful triumphal arch-like entrance into Bryn y
Gwyla Park, through which a new road is now forming to
Brynkinallt.&nbsp; This part of the domain is in Shropshire; the
interesting stream of the Ceiriog dividing Shropshire from
Denbighshire at this place.</p>
<p>As you proceed towards the river, whose sides are charmingly
clothed with forest trees, and whose banks are fringed with
shrubs to the water edge, the eye is caught by some of the
pinnacles of Brynkinallt, and by the blue smoke arising from the
mansion, which seems playfully to linger among the lofty summits
of the luxuriant trees that adorn it.&nbsp; Proceeding on the
highest road, called the Green Drive, which runs along the top of
the Hanging Wood, whose majestic and venerable timber seems to
continue the luxuriant line of wavy branches to the very mansion,
through one of the natural vistas which here and there present
themselves, Brynkinallt bursts upon the sight in all its beauty,
embosomed in the softened and variously tinted foliage of the
plantations which surround it.&nbsp; From this spot the most <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>interesting
and picturesque view of the place is obtained; and I believe it
is the point from whence an artist of some celebrity has designed
a picture of the mansion.</p>
<p>At the termination of this drive the murmuring Ceiriog is
crossed by an ornamental stone bridge, at the foot of which, on
the bank of the river, stands a simple rustic cottage, richly
clothed with ivy, and formed of unhewn pebble stones.&nbsp; At
this lodge is kept a key of the bridge gate; and a bell attached
to the gate procures attendance.&nbsp; Crossing the bridge into
Denbighshire, the elegant taste of the inheritor of the place
begins to display itself.&nbsp; New beauties appear at every
step, as you approach the house; pheasants feed in numbers on the
smooth verdant lawn before the windows, and seem to give an
earnest of the quiet and security of the domain.</p>
<p>This beautiful place is thus mentioned by Mr.
Pennant:&mdash;&ldquo;From Chirk (he says) I made an excursion to
Brynkinallt about a mile below the village: this had been the
seat of the Trevors.&nbsp; The house is of brick, built in
1619.&rdquo; <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a>&nbsp; Nor can I find more attention
bestowed on this charming place by any of the numerous tourists
who have given an account of their excursions to the public; and
I am at a loss to account why this, the most unique and beautiful
spot in the neighbourhood, should thus long have escaped
attention.</p>
<p>The house is undoubtedly the work of Inigo Jones, <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and was built
on the site of a former mansion of brick, either in the latter
part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, or early in the reign of
James I.&nbsp; The additions made by the present worthy possessor
are ornamental and useful, and are formed so judiciously, and so
strictly in character with the old part, as not to be
distinguished from the original design.&nbsp; I should call the
style demi-gothic; it is now cased over with mastic or Roman
cement, and has all the appearance of well hewn stone; and some
think it will have equal durability.</p>
<p>The house is formed with a noble mansion-like centre,
decorated with minarets and pinnacles, and flanked by two low
retiring wings, making altogether a very beautiful and ornamental
front.&nbsp; The grand entrance is through a conservatory and
viranda, elegantly decorated with choice flowers and exotic
plants.&nbsp; Over the inner entrance door are the arms of the
Marquis of Wellesley, Viceroy of Ireland, emblazoned upon glass,
occupying the whole width of the doorway, and bearing an
inscription, likewise painted on the glass, signifying that the
Marquis presented this painted glass as a mark of his esteem to
his dear friend and relation, Lord Viscount Dungannon.&nbsp; The
execution is good, and does great credit to the Irish artist.</p>
<p>Advancing a few steps into the interior, the eye is arrested
by the brilliancy of the scene which breaks upon the sight.&nbsp;
Immediately in front, through the spacious hall, is a grand
flight of stairs, terminated by a richly <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>stained glass
window, and leading to a gallery that surrounds the hall, and
which is decorated with the busts of much distinguished and
eminent persons, as the King, the Duke of York, the Duke of
Wellington, &amp;c.&nbsp; Up the passage to the left hand, the
view is bounded by the superb dining room; and on the right it
terminates in a charming conservatory, through which is a way to
the pleasure grounds and gardens.&nbsp; From the dining room on
the extreme left, to the conservatory on the right, it is about
one hundred and sixty feet.</p>
<p>To particularize or to give an adequate idea of the superb and
very tasteful decorations of every room in this elegant mansion
is far beyond my power of description; and therefore I dare not
make the attempt.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that every nook seems
decorated by the hand of taste, guided by the most correct
judgment; all is elegantly superb, and chastely grand.&nbsp; In
some of the windows is much old painted glass, particularly in
the library, where there are some very excellent specimens.</p>
<p>Here is also a valuable collection of china; and in one of the
rooms are some beautiful vases of that fragile material.</p>
<p>The mansion is adorned throughout with valuable pictures by
the old masters, some of which his Lordship selected in
Italy.&nbsp; There is a landscape near the fire-place, in the
same room where the china vases stand, painted by Claude
Lorraine, which is a most beautiful production of that great
master.&nbsp; In short,</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;Whatever in this worldly state<br />
Is sweet and pleasing unto living sense,<br />
Or that may daintiest fantasie aggrate,<br />
Is poured forth with plentiful dispense,<br />
And made there to abound with lavish affluence.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Spencer</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beauty and elegance abounding in this place must be seen
to be justly appreciated; and the urbanity and gentlemanly
condescension of the noble owner, in affording me the means of
gratifying my inquiries and curiosity, will never be effaced from
my memory.</p>
<p>In the adjoining shrubbery is an ornamental building called
the china room, fitted up (it would be superfluous to say
elegantly) by Lady Dungannon.&nbsp; Within the room are deposited
the most valuable and beautiful specimens of old china.&nbsp; The
walls are covered with plates, dishes, &amp;c. in many various
figures and forms.&nbsp; There is a fire-place in the room, and a
small portable collection of books for the amusement of a passing
hour.&nbsp; In a room adjoining is an assemblage of
cream-coloured pottery, in its greatest variety; and behind all,
is a cool, well arranged dairy.</p>
<p>To some, and to ladies in particular, the examination of the
china room will afford the highest gratification.&nbsp; For
myself, I must confess, the exquisite specimens of art I had just
been viewing in the mansion so entirely engrossed my mind, that I
could not look on these later morceaus with the attention they
merited.</p>
<p>I have before stated that the river Ceiriog runs through <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>part of the
domain; and it is made to contribute much to its beauty.&nbsp; It
passes through a deep and thickly wooded dingle, and a rural and
shady walk winds along the glen to another entrance lodge, about
half a mile from Chirk.&nbsp; The way is enlivened by game
springing before you at every step, and rousing the attention
from that soothing melancholy which the umbrageous solemnity of
the walk is calculated to inspire.</p>
<p>There are four lodges, or gates of entrance into the domain,
inhabited by some of his Lordship&rsquo;s dependents.&nbsp; They
are all built in an ornamental and romantic style; but about
them, though so varied in design, there are no disjointed or
distorted features to offend the most fastidious.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And that which all fair work doth much
aggrace,<br />
The art which wrought it all appeareth in no place.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Spencer</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brynkinallt, as well as Chirk, is on the English side of
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, to which I shall now return on my way to the
Berwyn Mountains; observing by the bye, that although this part
of the country is called Wales, yet that Offa&rsquo;s Dyke, made
in the year 776, cut it off from the Principality, and John of
Salisbury, in his Polycraticon, writeth thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Harold
ordained a law, that what Welchman soever should be found with a
weapon on this side the limit which he had set them (that is to
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>say,
Offa&rsquo;s Dyke,) he should have his right hand cut off by the
King&rsquo;s officers.&rdquo; <a name="citation24"></a><a
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; So, as Harold
II. reigned nearly three hundred years after the Dyke was cut, it
is plain, by this law, that it continued to be considered the
line of demarcation at that time; and even to this day the bell
of vassalage, the curfew, is rung every night at Chirk, that is,
on the English side the Dyke; but is never heard at Llangollen,
which is on the Welch side.&nbsp; This goes far to prove that
William&rsquo;s English law reached Chirk, and no farther.&nbsp;
Leaving the Dyke, I now return to the Berwyn Mountains.</p>
<h3>BERWYN MOUNTAINS.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Clouds rest on the hills: spirits fly, and
travellers fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are our chiefs of old?&nbsp; Where our Kings of
mighty name?&nbsp; The fields of their battle are silent: scarce
their mossy tombs remain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returning towards Llangollen by the old road near Chirk
Castle, called Oswestry way, the Berwyn Mountains begin to raise
their lofty summits. <a name="citation25"></a><a
href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a> These Mountains
occupy the eastern side of Merionethshire, and branch into the
counties of Denbigh and Montgomery.&nbsp; Their southern boundary
is the river Tannant; their <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>northern the Dee.&nbsp; Their length
from north to south is about sixteen miles; their breadth from
east to west varying from five to ten miles. <a
name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; Their highest tops are Cader
Fronwen, or the Whitebreast, and Cader Ferwyn.&nbsp; On the
summit of the former a large quantity of stones, collected from a
distance, and brought here with much labour and difficulty, are
cast round a stone pillar, marking the burial-place of some
chief, whose very name is now forgotten.</p>
<p>These Mountains, as I have before said, form the southern side
of the vale of Llangollen; and forming a frontier barrier for
this part of North Wales, they have been the scene of many a
bloody contest, and on these hills the hardy sons of Cambria have
successfully opposed the encroaching armies of their Saxon
neighbours.&nbsp; I trust my readers will excuse me if I relate
one of the most interesting events of that kind which took place
on this part of the Berwyn Mountains, and within my prescribed
limits.</p>
<p>Henry II. King of England, being exasperated by the repeated
predatory incursions of the Welch, <a name="citation26b"></a><a
href="#footnote26b" class="citation">[26b]</a> and by the
advantage they took of ravaging the English territories in his
frequent absence, and finding that no treaties could bind them,
resolved on his return from Normandy to lead an army against
Wales; and having assembled a strong body of veteran troops,
selected from <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>all parts of his very extensive dominions in Normandy,
Flanders, Anjou, Gascoine, and England, <a
name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a> and hearing of some daring inroads
made by the North Wales men, he early in the year 1165, put
himself at the head of this chosen army, and set forward for
North Wales, resolving to destroy without mercy every living
thing he could meet with.&nbsp; Having advanced to Croesoswallt,
now Oswestry, he encamped there, and sent forward a body of men
to try the passes of the Dyke and Ceiriog, who being met near
Castell Crogen, as has been before stated, were there defeated,
and buried in the Dyke.</p>
<p>It is probable that the victorious Welchmen were a party
detached from the Welch army; for Owen Gwynedd, then Prince of
Wales, having heard of the great preparations made by the King,
had very prudently confederated all the power of the country, and
had assembled his forces at Corwen, a very strong country in
Edernion, and there awaited the King&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; He
had with him, besides his brother Cadwalader, and all the power
of North Wales, Prince Rhys, with those of South Wales, Owen
Cyfeeliog and Madog Meredith, with the strength of Powis; in
short, all the forces the Welch could muster. <a
name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b"
class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<p>The King, finding the Welch so strong, and knowing their
fickleness, stayed some time at Oswestry, in expectation that a
confederacy so hastily formed would as <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>suddenly dissolve; but finding them
firm and determined in their adherence, and that his enemies were
so near, he became desirous to bring on an engagement.&nbsp; He
therefore moved towards the Dyke with his whole army, and pushed
on a party to the Ceiriog river, which washes the foot of the
Berwyn; giving orders that the banks should be cleared of the
woods, which at that time formed a complete jungle, to prevent
his troops falling into the ambuscade of the enemy.</p>
<p>It would seem the Welch had taken the precaution to guard the
passes of the river; for the King in person, in an attempt to get
possession of a bridge, experienced one of those hair-breadth
escapes which some times decide the fate of kingdoms: <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a>&mdash;A Welch archer, having marked the
personal exertions of the King, and fired with the hope of
freeing his country, chose a place of concealment, from whence,
watching his opportunity, he discharged an arrow with such deadly
aim, that it must inevitably have slain the King, had not Hubert
De St. Clair, Constable of Colchester, who was in close
attendance, and whose name is deservedly recorded for his
devotion to his monarch, seeing the danger, rushed into the
course of the fatal shaft, and received it in his heart; thus
terminating his attachment with his life.</p>
<p>Whilst Henry was thus employing his forces in clearing the
banks of Ceiriog, a party of Welchmen, relying <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>on their
knowledge of the country, and prompted by patriotic zeal,
attempted to surprise his vanguard, consisting chiefly of
pikemen, and the flower of the King&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; This
brought on a very bloody engagement, although not general, which
cost the lives of many brave men on both sides; but the attack
having been commenced without any preconcerted plan, and merely
from a sudden ebullition of desperate daring, Henry&rsquo;s
veterans were victorious, and making good the passage of the
river, advanced up the Berwyn.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the Welch Princes had advanced with their
army from Corwen, and had taken a strong position on the frontier
ridge.&nbsp; A fieldwork and entrenchment are still visible on
the Mountain, over Llangollen, and was probably the station of
part of the Welch forces, under Owen Gwynedd and his
allies.&nbsp; Henry, finding his formidable enemy thus
advantageously posted on the crown of the hill, did not deem it
prudent to attack him in this position, and therefore encamped
his forces on the lower part of the Mountain. <a
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29"
class="citation">[29]</a></p>
<p>In this manner the two armies lay menacing each other; the
Welch carefully improving every opportunity of annoyance, and
from their lofty and advantageous situation watching every
movement of the King&rsquo;s forces.&nbsp; Henry used every means
in his power to induce them to quit their camp, and attack him,
but in vain: while the Welch, by means of their irregular
adherents, cut off all supplies from the English, and reduced
them to the greatest straits and distress; added to which, the
rain <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>now
fell in torrents, and pouring down the sides of the Mountain,
rendered the English station so soft and slippery that they were
obliged to retreat, with great loss in men, horses, and warlike
stores, leaving the Welch masters of the field.</p>
<p>The Welchmen, as might naturally be expected, exultingly
celebrated this triumph; while Henry, baffled and disgraced, and
with all his threats unperformed, gave way to rage, and added
savage cruelty to his disgrace.&nbsp; He at this time held as
hostages Rhys and Cadwallon, the two sons of Owen Gwynedd; and
also Cynric and Meredith, the two sons of Rhys Ap Gryffyth, of
South Wales; as likewise the sons and daughters of other Welch
Lords. <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; In the savage fierceness of his
rage, he ordered the eyes of these innocent victims to be pulled
out, and the ears of the young gentlewomen to be stuffed.</p>
<p>From this digression, for which, as pointing out the places
where these historical facts happened, I hope my readers will
pardon me, I now return to the Oswestry old way, which runs near
Chirk Castle.</p>
<p>Not more than sixty years ago, this used to be the public high
road to Oswestry, although the capacious <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>and excellent
road which now skirts the Mountains&rsquo; base would almost
induce one to think it impossible.&nbsp; A very respectable and
old inhabitant of Llangollen informs me, that before the road was
altered and improved, some of the family from Chirk Castle used
to visit Llangollen once a year in the family coach.&nbsp; On the
appointed day, which was generally known beforehand, all the
inhabitants were on the alert; and no sooner was the rumble of
the ponderous wheels heard on the stones, than young and old,
sick and lame, poured out of their dwellings to see the wonderful
phenomenon; and during the few hours of its stay in the town, it
attracted as much attention as a show of wild beasts at a country
fair.&nbsp; On its return to the Castle, the young men of the
village contended for the honour of assisting it to get up the
hill again; and this was the only vehicle of the kind seen once a
year in Llangollen, where now the most splendid and elegant
carriages, from the gig to the state-coach, roll along, amid
these stupendous rocks and mountains, upon roads as smooth, as
level, and as good, as any in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Oswestry old way is not now much frequented, but it
continues from Chirk Castle along the top of the Mountain.&nbsp;
Many roads intersect it, but the old road is very
distinguishable.&nbsp; By the side of the way, rise two copious
springs, called Ffynnon Arthur.</p>
<p>From the eminence the view is most extensively delightful, and
amply repays the trouble and fatigue of <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the walk up
the Mountain.&nbsp; The curious Aqueduct of Pontcysyllte forms a
very pleasing and prominent feature in the foreground of the
landscape.</p>
<p>As you approach the descent on the side of the hill, the stone
pedestal of a cross or pillar stands among the gorse on the left
hand side of the road, but the shaft is not to be found.&nbsp;
Trees, planted three in a clump, mark the road at short
distances, and lead to the cultivated and inhabited part of the
declivity. <a name="citation32a"></a><a href="#footnote32a"
class="citation">[32a]</a>&nbsp; Proceeding to the extreme foot
of the Mountain, on the junction of the Oswestry road stood,
until these few months, another stone pillar, or cross, <a
name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b"
class="citation">[32b]</a> called Croes y Beddau; and upon it was
rudely cut &ldquo;<i>Oswestry Way</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
inscription is of more recent execution than the pillar, although
it is also very antique.</p>
<p>I conjecture these stones were erected as land-marks, and
guides to the traveller.&nbsp; An ancient way from this point
proceeded to the river Dee, which was then crossed by a wooden
bridge.&nbsp; On the north side of the river, nearly opposite the
place where the wooden bridge stood, was another similar pillar,
called Croes Gwen Hwyfr.&nbsp; It stood on the road to Wrexham,
and has been removed <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>only a few years.&nbsp; From Croes
Gwen Hwyfr, an old road proceeds to Castell Dinas Bran, by the
Llanddyn, once the residence of the Owens of Porkington, but now
converted into a farm-house.&nbsp; Through that farm the road
passed in a zigzag direction to Castell Dinas Bran, and the old
road is still traceable, although in some places quite lost.</p>
<p>Before I attempt to give an account of the ancient castle, I
must beg my reader&rsquo;s attendance to the Aqueduct, which
claimed notice in the view from the top of the Berwyn
Mountains.</p>
<h3>THE AQUEDUCT.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Telford, who o&rsquo;er the vale of
Cambrian Dee,<br />
Aloft in air, at giddy height upborne,<br />
Carried his navigable road, and hung<br />
High o&rsquo;er Menai&rsquo;s Straits and bending bridge:<br />
Structures of more ambitious enterprise<br />
Than minstrels, in the age of old romance,<br />
To their own Merlin&rsquo;s magic lore ascribed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Aqueduct of Pontcysyllte is so called from a bridge of
three arches over the river Dee, and situated a little higher up
the river.&nbsp; This is the most stupendous work of the kind in
the kingdom.&nbsp; It was designed and executed by and under the
inspection of that British Archimedes, Mr. Thomas Telford, to
carry a stream of water <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>for the supply of the Ellesmere
Canal; to the proprietors of which, in the year 1804, Sir W. W.
Wynn, Bart. in the most liberal manner made an important donation
of the waters of Bala pool, as far as wanted; and to obtain that
essential advantage the Aqueduct was projected. <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a>&nbsp; The level of the canal is taken
at a place in the river a little below the church of Llantysilio,
and about two miles, on the west of Llangollen.</p>
<p>The bank of the canal forms a charming promenade of about six
miles from its junction with the Dee to the Aqueduct, abounding
with interesting and picturesque scenery.&nbsp; Here and there
snug little white cottages, peeping from among the surrounding
trees, decorate and embellish the sides and recesses of some of
the eminences; while the tops are dotted with the little mountain
sheep, scarcely distinguishable from the white stones that are
scattered upon their summits.&nbsp; The banks of the canal are
ornamented with trees, and embellished with bridges, &amp;c.</p>
<p>This Aqueduct, the most extraordinary structure of its kind in
the world, was begun on the twenty-fifth day of July, 1795, and
was finished on the twenty-sixth day of November, 1805; having
been ten years and five months in building.&nbsp; It is one
thousand and seven feet in length, and one hundred and twenty-six
feet eight inches in height from the surface of the flat rock on
the <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>south
side of the river Dee, to the top of the iron side plates of the
water way; and there are nineteen arches of forty-five feet span
each.&nbsp; The piers, eighteen in number, are constructed of
square masonry, and the arches and water way are composed of
cast-iron.</p>
<p>At the south end of the Aqueduct there is an embankment of
earth, fifteen hundred feet in length, and seventy-five feet
high.&nbsp; The water way is eleven feet ten inches broad, and
five feet three inches deep.&nbsp; There is a broad towing-path
on the east side, guarded by a strong iron palisade, running the
whole length of the Aqueduct; from the north end of which the
canal is continued for a distance of about three hundred yards,
and there terminates in an extensive basin, which affords a
double wharfage, with iron railways.</p>
<p>I have heard of only one fatal accident occurring during the
progress of this arduous undertaking; when a poor labourer
employed on the work fell from the top of one of the piers, and
was dashed to pieces on the rock below.&nbsp; His suffering was
of short duration, as the tremendous height from which he fell
caused instant dissolution.</p>
<p>The Aqueduct crosses the entrance of the vale of Llangollen
from north to south, and the walks under and about it are really
charming.&nbsp; The view along the beautiful vale of the Dee from
the top, in the centre of the towing-path, is delightful, and to
look down tremendous; and the river,</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;That on the unnumber&rsquo;d pebbles idly
chafes,<br />
Cannot be heard so high.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, it requires a steady head, and a stout heart, to walk
over the Aqueduct, especially when the wind is high.</p>
<p>On the twenty-sixth day of November, 1805, the canal was
opened in the following manner, as described by one of the acting
Committee.&nbsp; He says&mdash;<a name="citation36"></a><a
href="#footnote36" class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In going over the Aqueduct and returning,
the sensations varied.&nbsp; As the procession of boats advanced
towards the noble structure now first commencing its public
utility, the complete sense of security in which we floated one
hundred and twenty-six feet above the river Dee, and a just
acknowledgment to Mr. Telford, to whom it was deservedly a proud
day, and who had most happily arranged the whole of our
accommodation, as well as constructed the wonderful edifice that
supported us, naturally united.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our arrival at the eastern bank, we entered the
canal port.&nbsp; Lady Bridgewater, the ladies of Colonel
Kynaston Powell, and William Lloyd Ashton, Esq. and some others,
as connected with the Committee, now attended Lady Eleanor
Butler, Lady W. W. Wynn and her family, the Hon. Miss Ponsonby,
Miss Ormsby, and many other respectable visitors, to a repast
which had been provided; soon after which an Oration was
delivered.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;On a signal being given, the cannon, which had
been advantageously posted on the platform below the rocks, and
nearly on a level with the Aqueduct, fired a royal salute.&nbsp;
The guns were manned by the Artillery Company, and were some of
those brought from the capture of Seringapatam, now belonging to
the Shropshire Volunteers, whose skill and martial appearance
added much to the brilliancy of the day: they saluted the
Committee on their passage and return with fifteen rounds
each.&nbsp; After the repast and Oration, the whole company
prepared to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The procession of boats was as follows:&mdash;In the
first and second boats, the Committee; in the third, the band of
the Shropshire Volunteers, in full uniform; the fourth was
occupied by the engineers, the occupiers of mines and founderies,
&amp;c. with their families.&nbsp; I was invited to take my
passage with them, having been engaged when the Committee set
out, and could from this boat, as a centre, better judge of the
whole.&nbsp; The fifth and sixth boats closed the procession,
gaily ornamented with flags, and loaded with the first commercial
product of coal that had ever passed over the valley on this
noble bridge of union.&nbsp; The carriages, which conveyed the
rest of the company, formed a curved and continued line over the
bridge of the Dee (Pontcysyllte) and on both its banks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evening was calm, and the favourite tunes of
&lsquo;<i>God save the King</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>Rule
Britannia</i>&rsquo; floated in the <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>air, amongst the echoes of the
vale.&nbsp; Many (probably more than eight thousand) people were
stationed all around us, from the tops of the mountains to the
banks of the Dee, and were cheering and exulting, with intervals
of silent astonishment.&nbsp; All within sight or hearing were
expressing their sense of the general happiness.&nbsp; The whole
valley of Llangollen might be said to laugh and sing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following inscription is on the Aqueduct upon the side of
the pier next to the south side of the river:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">The Nobility and Gentry

<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Returning from this stupendous work of human ingenuity
and exertion, towards the Castell Dinas Bran,</p>
<h3>TREVOR HALL,</h3>
<p>A large brick mansion, presents itself.&nbsp; It is situated
on a rising ground, on the north side of the Wrexham road; and
was once the residence of John Trevor, Bishop of St. Asaph, who
in the year 1346, caused a stone bridge to be built over the Dee,
at Llangollen, which is accounted one of the wonders of
Wales.</p>
<p>Mr. Pennant says <a name="citation39"></a><a
href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> &ldquo;Trevor Hall
passed into the family of the Lloyds, and has continued in that
family to the present time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last possessor was a
lady of the name of Thomas, deceased in the year 1826, and
leaving a son to inherit, although at present he does not occupy
the premises.&nbsp; The house is roomy and substantial, and is
pleasantly situated; but has no pretensions to elegance or
beauty.&nbsp; Near the house is a church, or rather chapel, of
ease, enjoying Queen Anne&rsquo;s bounty, in which English
service is performed on the first Sunday in every month.</p>
<p>In a rocky cliff in the neighbourhood of the Hall, is a cavern
of some extent, in which I was informed there were to be found
the petrified bones of wolves, foxes, and other wild
animals.&nbsp; Resolving to ascertain the fact, I explored the
place, but, whatever there may have been, <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>I could not
discover the vestiges of any such relics.&nbsp; I brought away
some specimens of stalactites, of curious forms and various
incrustations, with which the roof of the cavern abounds, and
which may by some have been mistaken for petrified bony
substances.&nbsp; This craggy ridge seems to be the commencement
of that wonderful range of limestone called the Eglwyseg
Rocks.</p>
<p>Near to the river is the ancient house of Plas yn Pentre, now
inhabited by Mr. Thomas Rogers; and between Trevor Hall and the
Dee is one of the most beautifully clear springs of cold water
imaginable.&nbsp; It is called Ffynnon Yryrog, and is in very
great repute as a bath for the cure of rheumatic affections; and
if Saint Collen with a long name <a name="citation40"></a><a
href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a> had thought proper
to have bestowed his benediction, it might perhaps have rivalled
its prototype at Holywell.&nbsp; Its issue is very abundant, and
its coldness exceeds belief: persons bathing cannot continue in
the water a minute.&nbsp; Many wonderful accounts are told of its
efficacy in chronic disorders.&nbsp; In its passage to the Dee,
it formerly turned a water mill, now in ruins.&nbsp; The spring
rises in a field belonging to Plas yn Pentre.</p>
<p>On the road side, between Trevor Hall and Bron Heulog, is a
small farm house, called Plas Eva or Evan.&nbsp; I notice it only
as marking the spot where formerly was a cemetery, retaining the
appellation of Mynwent y Quacer, <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>or Quaker&rsquo;s Burying
Ground.&nbsp; It is on the south side of the house; and in
cutting the canal, the earth from the excavation was thrown upon
the old graves and the inscribed stones that lay upon the
surface.</p>
<p>Opposite the north side of the same house, a few years ago, as
some labourers were working in the limestone rock, they
discovered a pot, filled with gold coin.&nbsp; The men, afraid of
losing their booty, kept the affair secret, and deputed one of
their party to dispose of the treasure at Chester, as old
gold.&nbsp; A rumour of the circumstance having got afloat, an
inquiry was instituted; but the secret was so well kept on all
hands, that only one piece, which a labourer had kept as a
curiosity, with a part of the earthen vessel that contained them,
were recovered, both of which I am informed are now in the
possession of Lady Clive.&nbsp; The name, date, or nominal value
of the coin, I cannot ascertain; but a person who saw one of the
pieces describes it as being about the size of a half crown, and
very thin, with an impression on each side.</p>
<p>About a mile nearer to the Castle, stands a recently erected
mansion, called Bron Heulog.&nbsp; It is only remarkable for the
narrowness of its windows and the nakedness of its
appearance.&nbsp; Nearing the town on the bank of the river,</p>
<h3>THE VICARAGE,</h3>
<p>A neat pretty edifice, claims notice.&nbsp; It was built in
the year 1817, under the direction of the present vicar, the <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Rev. R. W.
Eyton, who resides here, and is an able conscientious
minister.</p>
<p>Having thus given an account of some of the most remarkable
features of the country within my limits on the north side of the
river, and on the east end of the town, I beg my readers to cross
the river with me to Pengwern Hall, situated on the south of the
Dee, with which I shall conclude my account of residences on the
east of the town, as it is not in my plan to notice the many
pretty snug and pleasant looking retreats with which the
delightful landscape is studded, the beauty and comfort of which
the traveller of taste will not fail fully to appreciate.&nbsp;
Nor have I much to say of</p>
<h3>LLYS PENGWERN;</h3>
<p>For mouldering time hath swept away much of its grandeur and
its form.</p>
<p>Llys, i.e. Palace or Prince&rsquo;s Court, of Pengwern, is
situated at the foot of Pen y Coed, a tumulus-like hill on the
east side of Llangollen, in a well cultivated and fruitful
valley, formed between, or rather of, the bases of Pen y Coed,
and the Berwyn.&nbsp; Little remains of the old house.&nbsp;
There are two vaulted rooms (the use of which I cannot
conjecture) standing at the end of the present house; and they
are, I think, part of the old palace.&nbsp; The roofs are formed
with nine stone ribs, which support a stone floor; for the rooms
are one above the other, and the little light admitted is through
narrow <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>loop-hole windows.&nbsp; There is no vault or cellar
beneath them.&nbsp; The site is extensive, and many old pointed
gothic windows appear about the dilapidated walls.</p>
<p>The place is now in the occupation of a very respectable
farmer.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Mostyn, Bart. is the proprietor, in
whose family it has been a great many years.&nbsp; I find that
&ldquo;Tudor Trevor, <a name="citation43"></a><a
href="#footnote43" class="citation">[43]</a> who in the British
genealogies is reckoned to be lineally descended from Vortigern,
that unfortunate King of the Britons, who first invited the
Saxons over into his country, married Gwladdis (some call her
Anghariad,) daughter of Howell Dda, King of all Wales, by whom he
had issue three sons; from the eldest of whom, Llwydocca, this
family of Mostyn is descended in a direct male line.&nbsp; Tudor
Trevor lived about A.D. 924, and his usual residence was at Llys
Pengwern, in Chirkland, in Denbighshire; which site, and lands
about it (though the house has been long destroyed,) is in the
possesion of the family to this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a stone which seems to have belonged to the old Llys,
wrought up in the door-way, with an inscription which I cannot
decipher.&nbsp; The design seems a rude figure of a sword, with
an obtuse point, and the letters cut in relief on the
blade.&nbsp; They are many of them unlike the characters I have
seen, although some of them bear a strong resemblance to the
Roman, and some few to the Saxon.&nbsp; The hilt of the sword, on
which was the <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>beginning of the inscription, is wanting.&nbsp; This is
the only inscribed stone I could discover on the premises,
although I was civilly assisted in my researches by the occupier
of the house.&nbsp; From the appearance of many of the windows,
&amp;c. I should almost suppose it the remains of a religious
sanctuary.</p>
<p>Returning to the north side of the Dee, I must notice a small
factory, where cotton <a name="citation44a"></a><a
href="#footnote44a" class="citation">[44a]</a> is spun and
manufactured into cloth by machinery.&nbsp; It was erected by a
Mr. Turner.&nbsp; The main wheel is worked by a partial diversion
of the river.&nbsp; It has also a claim upon the Ellesmere Canal
for a supply of water, and affords employment for many of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; The builder and his partner unfortunately
proving insolvent, the concern was for a while stopped, and the
factory stood unoccupied about five years.&nbsp; It is now
carried on by a very respectable firm from Manchester, <a
name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a> and is a great benefit to the
town.&nbsp; The factory was destroyed by fire in 1814, but being
fully insured it was soon rebuilt.&nbsp; By means of an outlet
from the mill dam, a great quantity of fine trout and salmon are
caught here in the season.</p>
<p>I shall now proceed to give some account of Castell Dinas
Bran, to which I had before conducted my reader by the ancient
road from the Berwyn Mountains, &amp;c.</p>
<h3><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>CASTELL DINAS BRAN.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Desolate is the dwelling of Morna: silence
is in the house of her fathers.&nbsp; The voice of the people is
heard no more.&nbsp; The stream of Cultha is removed from its
place by the fall of its walls.&nbsp; Raise the song of mourning,
O bards.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Castell Dinas Bran, vulgarly called Crow Castle, is one of
the primitive Welch Castles.&nbsp; I shall but bewilder myself or
my readers, by seeking for the origin of its name, which so many
learned men have sought in vain; all their researches ending in
conjecture: nor can I find any account to be relied upon, when or
by whom it was erected.</p>
<p>The Castle stands, as hath before been shown, immediately
above and on the north side of Llangollen, on a conical mountain,
about six hundred yards above the level of the river Dee; <a
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a> and is built on the summit of the hill,
which probably was leveled to procure materials, as the building
occupies the whole flat.&nbsp; It seems to have been about one
hundred yards in length, by fifty yards wide.&nbsp; The present
remains are almost without form: they are built of the silicious
stone of the mountain, set in a coarse mortar or grout, which is
grown as hard as the stone itself.&nbsp; There are here and there
scattered <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>remains of hewn stone for facings, &amp;c. some vestiges
of a small round tower and a vaulted passage, and also a very
limpid stream, now almost choked with ruins.</p>
<p>A room <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a> has been built within these few years,
for the shelter and convenience of visitors to the Castle; the
key of which may be obtained at a little white cottage half way
up the hill, inhabited by a very civil woman of the name of
Parry, who conducts the visitants, and provides them with tea if
required.</p>
<p>The Castle is conjectured to have been built by the Britons
before the Roman invasion; and was probably the residence of
Eliseg in the year 600. <a name="citation46b"></a><a
href="#footnote46b" class="citation">[46b]</a>&nbsp; In the
absence of all authentic accounts, I present my readers with a
free translation of what I conceive to be a legendary tale,
hoping it will at least amuse.</p>
<p>I find in the fragment of an old Welch book (from which the
title-page is lost,) obligingly lent to me by Mr. Edward Morris,
of Rhisgog, to whom I am indebted for much valuable information,
the following account of the building of Castell Dinas
Bran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Duke of Difnal, or Cornwall, having
conquered all his enemies, was crowned King, and reigned in peace
forty years, leaving at his death his kingdom to his two sons,
who were twins; Beli was the firstborn, Bran was the
youngest.&nbsp; They began to reign Anno Mundi 3600, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>but
contentions soon arising between them, they appealed to arms, and
called their friends and adherents to the field; and,
notwithstanding the persuasions and remonstrances of the chiefs
and great men of the country, a day was appointed for the
decision of their claims by arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meanwhile, their mother, the old Queen Corwena,
obtained an interview with her sons in her own apartments; when,
placing herself between them, she fell on her knees, her grey
hair disheveled, and her bosom bare, and thus addressed
them:&mdash;&lsquo;O! my dear sons, look on your mother, and for
her sake forbear to shed the blood of your friends; remember, it
is the Queen who solicits you to peace and unity; and remember
also that the blood of those brave men who fall in this quarrel
will cry for vengeance, and a life for a life, and a tooth for a
tooth, will be required.&nbsp; Consider, you once lived together
in peace upon this bosom, and now this great kingdom is too small
for you.&nbsp; For God&rsquo;s sake, and as you value my
blessing, cast away this fierce wrath; be not more cruel than the
wolves of your forests, and the bears of your woods.&nbsp; See
how my tears fall upon those breasts where you were wont to be
cherished together.&nbsp; Do not let me go to my dark house in
sorrow.&nbsp; Throw down your arms, and embrace each other as
brothers, that God may bless the end of your days with peace and
prosperity, and crown your wives and your children with comfort
and joy.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;The two brothers were so affected by this address
from their mother, that they both assisted to raise her from her
knees, and intreated her blessing.&nbsp; They then embraced, and
drinking to their mother and to each other, dismissed their
armies.&nbsp; Beli went to New Troy, <a name="citation48a"></a><a
href="#footnote48a" class="citation">[48a]</a> and Bran took up
his residence at a strong fortress, which he had built near
Llan-collen, <a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a> and called Dinas Bran, after his own
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen, returning to the portion of land which had
been given to her as a jointure, there built a small town, which
she named after herself, Corwen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following seems to be another version of the same story;
and as the Brut from which it is taken is by the learned
translator supposed to be the real Book of Gildas, <a
name="citation48c"></a><a href="#footnote48c"
class="citation">[48c]</a> I hope the antiquity and rarity of the
account will be a sufficient excuse to my general
readers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beli and Bran were the sons of Dyfnwal, and
began to reign 667 years before Christ. <a
name="citation48d"></a><a href="#footnote48d"
class="citation">[48d]</a> A violent struggle arose for the
sovereignty of the kingdom, which ended in it being divided
between them: however, in process of time, ambition again
prompted the two brothers to collect their respective forces, in
order to obtain supremacy; but when the two armies were about to
engage, their mother the old Queen Torwen, or Tarevin, rushed <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>between the
lines, and hastening to her son Bran, who had long been absent
from her, she tenderly embraced him, and with many sighs and
tears intreated him to be reconciled to his brother Beli.&nbsp;
Her intreaties so wrought upon Bran that he turned all his
thoughts to peace, and laying aside his helmet, he went unarmed
to meet his brother.&nbsp; A reconciliation then took place, the
forces on each side throwing down their arms, and approving the
peace; and both parties went together to London, at that time
called Troia Newydd.&rdquo; <a name="citation49"></a><a
href="#footnote49" class="citation">[49]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Eliseg&rsquo;s Pillar has given a name to a fertile valley,
to a township, and to the wonderful and stupendous Eglwyseg
Rocks, and which they all retain to this day, I presume to ask,
is it not as reasonable to suppose, since we find it recorded
that there was a British King of the name of Bran, that the name
of the Castle I am describing should have been derived from him,
rather than from a paltry stream bearing the name of Bran, or
from an insignificant bird; for Bran in the Welch language
signifies Crow.&nbsp; Might not, also, the streamlet of the Bran
take its name from the city of Bran? for I find in
Richards&rsquo;s Welch Dictionary, &ldquo;Dinas,&rdquo; English
&ldquo;City;&rdquo; therefore, &ldquo;Castell Dinas Bran,&rdquo;
i.e. &ldquo;The Castle of the City of Bran;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Din,&rdquo; &ldquo;a fortified city or mount,&rdquo; as
Dinbren, which adjoins the Castle Hill.&nbsp; Should these hints,
which with all deference I venture to suggest, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>invite others
to a deeper and more successful research, I shall be happy; and I
sincerely wish some one may prosecute further inquiry, furnished
with more ample materials, and endowed with a superior degree of
antiquarian knowledge.</p>
<p>Leaving apocryphal accounts, I find that Madog Ap Gryffydd
Maelor, who founded the Abbey Crucis A.D. 1200, and who was by
his mother&rsquo;s side the grandson of Gwen Gwynedd, Prince of
North Wales, resided at Castell Dinas Bran. <a
name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a>&nbsp; He inherited Powis Madoc, and
was Lord of the second Bromfeild and Mochnant Is Rhauader. <a
name="citation50b"></a><a href="#footnote50b"

<p>In the year 1209, Madog, forgetting his duty to his country
and to his prince, led his vassals and adherents to join the
English army under King John, then lying at Oswestry <a
name="citation50c"></a><a href="#footnote50c"
class="citation">[50c]</a> (Wynne says at Chester <a
name="citation50d"></a><a href="#footnote50d"
class="citation">[50d]</a>); where he had assembled a great
force, and with his usual violence and passion had resolved to
execute the severest vengeance on the inhabitants of North Wales,
and not to suffer a person to remain alive in the country.&nbsp;
But such resolves are sooner made than executed; and Llewellyn,
Prince of Wales, no sooner heard of these mighty preparations,
and of the disaffection of some of his own countrymen,
particularly of the Lord of Dinas Bran, than he issued his orders
to his subjects in the counties of Denbigh and <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Flint, to
remove all their cattle and moveable substance for a season, to
the mountains of Snowdon; by which means, and by getting into the
rear of the King&rsquo;s army, now advanced as far as the Castle
of Treganwy, he so straitened and harassed the English forces,
that, after eating their horses, and being reduced to the
greatest extremity, they were obliged to retrace their steps at
that time in disgrace, and breathing revenge, which the King in
some measure executed the next year. <a name="citation51a"></a><a
href="#footnote51a" class="citation">[51a]</a>&nbsp; But as I
mean to confine myself to the history of the Lords of Dinas Bran,
I will not deviate from my plan, by noticing matter which may be
deemed extraneous.</p>
<p>When John by his maladministration had quarrelled with his
great Barons, and thrown England into confusion, the vaccillating
Madog, Lord of Dinas Bran, again swore fealty to his lawful
Prince, Llewellyn, who politically overlooked his disaffection,
and accepted his submission.&nbsp; This and some other accession
of force enabled the Welch Prince successfully to assail the
English, from whom he took all the castles the King had
garrisoned, and most cruelly and unjustly put to death all their
defenders in cold blood.&nbsp; This happened A.D. 1213. <a
name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b"
class="citation">[51b]</a>&nbsp; The remainder of the time of
this factious man, Madog, was occupied in rapine, war, and
slaughter; and he closed his turbulent life in Castell Dinas
Bran, and was buried at his Abbey of Llan Egwest, or Valle
Crucis, A.D. 1236, <a name="citation51c"></a><a
href="#footnote51c" class="citation">[51c]</a> <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>leaving his
son Lord of Powis Fadog, Lord of Dinas Bran, and all his other
signiorities.</p>
<p>Gryffydd Ap Madog, like his father, partook of the character
of the times, and was fickle and turbulent.&nbsp; His father,
Madog Ap Gryffydd Maelor, had generally resided at Wattstay, now
Wynnstay; but Gryffydd Ap Madog made the Castell Dinas Bran his
chief residence, and it is probable that his confidence in this
almost inaccessible retreat might strengthen and encourage him in
his waywardness.</p>
<p>I find him joining Prince Edward, the son of Henry III. then
King of England, with all his forces, in the year 1257; and his
disaffection is thus stigmatized by the old writers: <a
name="citation52a"></a><a href="#footnote52a"
class="citation">[52a]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;But Gryffydd Ap Madog
Maelor, Lord of Dinas Bran, a person of notorious reputation for
injustice and oppression, basely forsook the Welch, his
countrymen, and with all his forces went over to the Earl of
Chester.&rdquo; <a name="citation52b"></a><a href="#footnote52b"
class="citation">[52b]</a></p>
<p>The following year, Llewellyn the Prince, returning from an
expedition into South Wales, met the Earl, and forced him to
retreat with great precipitation, leaving the possessions of his
unnatural allies at the mercy of the conqueror, who now resolved
to be revenged on that ungrateful fugitive, the Lord of Dinas
Bran.&nbsp; He therefore passed through Bromfeild, and miserably
laid waste the whole country, and obliged Gryffydd to keep close
in <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>his
Castle of Dinas Bran, which, being situated on the summit of a
very steep hill, seemed impregnable to all the daring efforts
that could be used against it. <a name="citation53"></a><a
href="#footnote53" class="citation">[53]</a></p>
<p>King Henry, being now much incensed against the Welch Prince
Llewellyn, on account of the obstinate resistance he experienced,
and having drawn together the whole strength of England, even
from St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, in Cornwall, to the river Tweed,
marched with his son Edward in great rage to North Wales, and
without any opposition advanced as far as Treganwy; but Llewellyn
having taken precaution, as was the practice of the Welch in
cases of invasion, to have all manner of provision and forage
carried over the river, and having secured the strait and narrow
passages whereby the English might advance into the country, the
King&rsquo;s troops were in a short time so mortally harassed and
fatigued, that they were obliged to return to England in haste,
and with great loss.</p>
<p>Gryffydd Ap Madog, finding King Henry unable to protect his
estate, submitted to his rightful Prince; and Llewellyn then
passed to Powis, and banished Gryffydd Ap Gwenwynwyn, who had
also joined the English, and took all the lands in the country of
Powis into his own hands.</p>
<p>Llewellyn, who was a politic prince, received the submission
of the Lord of Dinas Bran, because he knew <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>that
inaccessible fortress could not be forced from him, and that it
would not be safe to have an avowed enemy, with so strong a
refuge for his disaffected subjects, in the rear of his
operations; otherwise Gryffydd Ap Madog had merited banishment as
much as his namesake of Powisland: nay, Gryffydd, Lord of Dinas
Bran, married an English lady, <a name="citation54a"></a><a
href="#footnote54a" class="citation">[54a]</a> Emma, daughter of
Lord Audley, whose father did much mischief and hurt to the
Welch, by bringing from Germany a body of horsemen, who, by the
uncommon size of their horses, with their unusual manner of
fighting, terrified and easily defeated the Welchmen at the
first; but when they had become more familiarized with their
mode, they took their revenge upon them, even on Lord
Audley&rsquo;s own land. <a name="citation54b"></a><a
href="#footnote54b" class="citation">[54b]</a></p>
<p>All the nobility of Wales had solemnly sworn to defend their
country till death against the invasion of the English, and not
to relinquish or forsake one another; and the return of Gryffydd
Ap Madog to his allegiance diffused through every breast the hope
of better days. <a name="citation54c"></a><a href="#footnote54c"
class="citation">[54c]</a></p>
<p>From this time to the day of his death, I do not find that he
again deserted his Prince, but attached himself to the fortunes
of his country, although fears of the resentment of his
countrymen for his former conduct made him keep close to his
Castle of Dinas Bran, where he died in 1270, <a
name="citation54d"></a><a href="#footnote54d"
class="citation">[54d]</a> and was buried by the side of his
father <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>in
the Abbey Church of Valle Crucis; leaving his country in the
enjoyment of freedom and peace; the Welch having, by innate
bravery and constancy, aided by the fastnesses of their country,
and the good policy of their Prince, freed themselves for a time
from the thraldom of their potent enemy.</p>
<p>Mr. Pennant gives a different account of his end. <a
name="citation55a"></a><a href="#footnote55a"
class="citation">[55a]</a>&nbsp; He says that &ldquo;his wife
Emma, having alienated his affection from his own country, made
him an instrument of its subjection, and of the destruction of
his own family; for, as he took part with Henry III. and Edward
I. against his natural Prince, the resentment of his countrymen
was excited against him, and he was obliged to shelter himself
from their rage in his Castle of Dinas Bran, where probably shame
and grief put an end to his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Gryffydd Ap Madog, by his wife Emma,
daughter of John, Lord Audley, left issue four sons, viz. Madog,
Llewellyn, Gryffydd, and Owen. <a name="citation55b"></a><a
href="#footnote55b" class="citation">[55b]</a>&nbsp; Madog, the
eldest, became Lord of Dinas Bran, &amp;c.&nbsp; He died, it is
supposed, not long after his father, leaving two sons to inherit
his property. <a name="citation55c"></a><a href="#footnote55c"
class="citation">[55c]</a>&nbsp; The eldest, called Madog, had,
by his father&rsquo;s will, Bromfeild and Yale, the Castell Dinas
Bran, &amp;c.; the second son, Llewellyn, the Lordship of Chirk,
&amp;c.&nbsp; It should seem these children were not of age when
their father died; for Edward I. <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>King of England, took on him to
appoint guardians to them both, and committed Madog, the elder,
to the care of John, Earl of Warren, one of his favorites; and
Llewellyn he intrusted to Roger Mortimer, son of Lord Mortimer,
of Wigmore. <a name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a> These men well understood the nature
of the appointment; and it is probable that Edward had maturely
weighed in his mind the potency of their enmity, who could be
such powerful friends, and having then but recently subjugated
the country, he might wish out of his way two scions of a stock
which had proved so stubborn and so valiant.&nbsp; It was well
known that Warren and Mortimer had rid themselves of their
respective charges, and had possessed themselves of their
estates, which they were suffered to enjoy without an inquiry
being instituted respecting them, or about the disappearance of
their wards; but the manner of the murder of these two
unfortunate children has but lately been discovered, in a
manuscript in the Bodleian Library. <a name="citation56b"></a><a
href="#footnote56b" class="citation">[56b]</a>&nbsp; The guardian
of the two boys caused them to be drowned under Holt Bridge; and
no doubt from hence arose the origin of a fable which was long
current in the country, of two fairies having been drowned in
that place.</p>
<p>From the Earls of Warren the Castell Dinas Bran passed to the
Arundel <a name="citation56c"></a><a href="#footnote56c"
class="citation">[56c]</a> and other families.&nbsp; In 1390,
Myfanwy Fechan, a descendant of the house of Tudor, resided
there, and was celebrated for her beauty in a long <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>ode by Howel
Ap Einion Lygliw, a celebrated bard of that time.&nbsp; The
Castle was probably then held under the Earls of Arundel.&nbsp;
It is now the property of Mrs. Myddelton Biddulph, of Chirk
Castle.&nbsp; The period of its destruction is as completely
unknown as the time of its foundation.&nbsp; Eagles and hawks in
abundance used to breed, as some now do, in the neighbouring
rocky ridge of the Eglwyseg, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Along the narrow valley you might see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wild deer sporting on the meadow ground,<br />
And here and there a solitary tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or mossy stone, or rock with woodbine
crown&rsquo;d.<br />
Oft did the cliffs reverberate the sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of parted fragments tumbling from on high,<br />
And from the summit of that craggy mound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The perching eagle oft was heard to cry,<br />
Or on resounding wing to shoot athwart the sky.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The view from the Castle is not so extensive as might be
expected from its elevation, being bounded, except towards the
east, by more lofty mountains; yet the scenery is most truly
grand and magnificent.&nbsp; According to the plan laid down in
the beginning of this work, I leave my readers to their own
observations; only informing them that the house which makes a
distinguished figure to the westward is Dinbren Hall, the
residence of Richard Jones, Esq.</p>
<p>Descending on the west side of the hill, and proceeding on the
old way to the Abbey Crucis, stands a neat house, called the
T&#373;r, i.e. Tower, which I conjecture, for I can <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>obtain no
written document on the subject, to have been a look-out or
watch-tower belonging to the Castle; especially as it is placed
on the side most easy of access.&nbsp; Some additions have been
made to the Tower, and it is now a comfortable farm-house,
inhabited by a very respectable lady, of the name of Price.&nbsp;
It has been a square building, built of hewn stone, as evinced by
the massive walls which now surround the old part converted into
a parlour, and by an old spiral stone stair at the back of the
room.</p>
<p>The old way from the Castle to the Abbey has been much
intersected and crossed, especially by the branch of the
Ellesmere Canal, and by roads made to recently erected retreats
and farms; among which I must not, however, reckon the road
to</p>
<h3>LLANTYSILIO,</h3>
<p>Which is a place of great antiquity.&nbsp; It belonged of old
time to the ancient family of the Cuppers of the North, <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a> so called even in the time of King
Henry II.; and by the marriage of a daughter of that family with
a Mr. Jones, of Llanbothian, in Montgomeryshire, it became the
heritage of the late possessor of that name, and is now inhabited
by Major Harrison, <a name="citation58b"></a><a
href="#footnote58b" class="citation">[58b]</a> who resides in the
Hall, a large brick building, bearing a strong affinity to Trevor
Hall in antiquity of erection.&nbsp; It is situated in a <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>pleasant
valley, watered by the river Dee, over which it enjoys a fine
prospect.</p>
<p>The Church of Llantysilio is dedicated to a Welch saint, from
whom the township takes its name.&nbsp; He was Prince of Powis,
and was called St. Tysilio.&nbsp; It is a neat little edifice,
with a very pleasant church-yard, and contains nothing very
ancient in the monumental way; but there are around it many very
venerable yew trees, with their, wide spreading sombre
foliage.&nbsp; I had the curiosity to measure one, and found it
above twenty feet in girth.&nbsp; The inside of the Church is,
like its neighbour at Llangollen, indebted for some of its
decorations to the Abbey Crucis, which seems after its
dissolution to have been considered as lawful plunder; and this
circumstance in some measure accounts for its so speedy
dilapidation.</p>
<h3>VALLE CRUCIS ABBEY.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How many hearts have here grown cold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That sleep these mouldering stones among!<br />
How many beads have here been told!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How many matins here been sung!<br />
But here no more soft music floats,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No holy anthems chanted now;<br />
All hush&rsquo;d, except the ring-dove&rsquo;s notes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Low murmuring from yon beachen bough.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Abbey of Llan Egwest, or Valle Crucis, so called from a
very ancient inscribed pillar or cross, the mutilated <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>remains of
which stand in an adjacent field, and will next come under
consideration, was built and founded by Madog Ap Gryffydd Maelor,
Lord of Dinas Bran, as before related under the head of Dinas
Bran.</p>
<p>This Abbey was built in the year of our Lord 1200, was
dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and belonged to a community of
Cistercian Monks, an order founded in France in the year
1098.&nbsp; The remains of the Abbey Church are the most
picturesque and entire part.&nbsp; It was built in the form of a
cross, which was contrary to the form in common use before the
twelfth century. <a name="citation60a"></a><a href="#footnote60a"
class="citation">[60a]</a></p>
<p>This proves that Madog availed himself of the aid of skilful
workmen, and it is probable that the fraternity called Free
Masons were employed, as they were incorporated about this time,
and were the chief undertakers of such works.&nbsp; Their
government was regular, and they were wont to make an encampment
of huts.&nbsp; A surveyor governed in chief; every tenth man
being called a warden, and overlooking nine.&nbsp; They ranged
from one country to another, as they found churches to be built.
<a name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a></p>
<p>The Church is built in different styles of architecture.&nbsp;
The east end seems the most ancient, and the three lancet-like
arched windows have a very peculiar effect.&nbsp; It is situated
at the foot of a lofty hill, called Fron Fawr, and a little
stream runs at the back of the Abbey, skirting <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>its gardens,
and turning a corn-mill in its passage to the Dee.&nbsp; The view
from the high bank beyond the rivulet (which is crossed by a
rustic plank bridge) of the east end of the Church and Abbey, is
particularly beautiful.</p>
<p>On its front or west side rise the Berwyn Mountains; on the
east, the Fron Fawr; and the whole is so enveloped in beautiful
foliage that it is perhaps one of the most enchantingly secluded
places in the kingdom.&nbsp; The west front of the Church affords
some admirable specimens of ancient gothic architecture.&nbsp;
The grand entrance has been through the ornamented pointed arch
gateway at the west end; over which is a fine gothic window,
consisting of three lancet-shaped arches, surmounted by a
circular or rose window, of eight divisions; but it is too lofty
to admit of close inspection, as is also the following mutilated
inscription, which is above it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>AD&mdash;ADAM&mdash;DMS fecit hoc opus.&nbsp; Pace
beata quiescat.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>MD&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the last line is obliterated.&nbsp; The following
translation may not be unacceptable:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>AD&mdash;ADAM&mdash;DMS built (or rebuilt) this
work.&nbsp; May he rest in happy peace.</p>
<p>Amen.&nbsp; MD&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The letters MD seem to have been meant as part of the date
marking the time when the Church was repaired, and go far to
prove the little veneration shown to this once elegant structure
by the neighbouring people, and that its dilapidation was
unusually rapid.&nbsp; Now, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>we will suppose that the inscription
MD means 1500, and allow that it was then in complete repair, and
that it was one of the first Abbeys dissolved, say in 1538; for I
do not read that Henry VIII. began his reformation among the
religious houses before that time; I find in Camden&rsquo;s
Britannia, speaking of this place, the following
passage:&mdash;&ldquo;Save onely a little Abbey, now wholly
decaied, but standing most richly and pleasantly in a vale, which
among the woody hils cutteth itself overthwart in manner of a
crosse, whereupon it was called in Latin Vallis Crucis, that is,
the Vale of the Crosse, and in British, Lhane Gwest.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a></p>
<p>Camden&rsquo;s great work, Britannia, was published in 1586;
and from these facts I draw my conclusion that it was ransacked
and destroyed soon after its dissolution, as I suppose it
was&mdash;</p>
<p>In complete repair, A.D. 1500;</p>
<p>Dissolved by order of Henry VIII. A.D. 1538; <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a></p>
<p>Wholly decayed, as by Camden, 1586. <a
name="citation62c"></a><a href="#footnote62c"
class="citation">[62c]</a></p>
<p>Of the magnificence of this ancient Monastery no adequate
description can now be given, and scarcely an idea formed of what
it has been.&nbsp; The body and nave of <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>the Church
are disfigured, and nearly choked up with masses of ruins, and
large and luxuriant forest trees, among which the ash and
sycamore are most predominant.&nbsp; The length of the Church is
about one hundred and eighty feet; the width I can only guess at,
as the north side is wholly gone.&nbsp; An author before me says
the nave was thirty-one feet broad, and the side aisle thirteen
feet.</p>
<p>In the north transept are the remains of a chapel, said by
some to have contained the tomb of the founder.&nbsp; In a wall
in the cloister stands a double benetoir, or vessel for holy
water.&nbsp; The cloister is small and gloomy, whose</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Storied windows, richly dight,<br />
Have shed a dim religions light.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solemnity of the place, and the stillness that reigns,
aided by the subdued light of the moon, and by a vivid fancy, may
conjure up strange ideas, and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Still may imagination&rsquo;s ardent eye<br
/>
In the tall grove the sage&rsquo;s form espy;<br />
See him intent with sacred zeal to plan<br />
Some moral lesson for ungrateful man.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The part of the Abbey now remaining is inhabited by a farmer,
who will show the premises on proper application.&nbsp; There is
a Saxon or semicircular arched gateway in the farm-yard,
adjoining a very curious gothic window, well worthy
attention.&nbsp; The dormitory or sleeping cells were formerly
entered by stone stairs from the outside, which have been removed
some years ago.&nbsp; The floor of <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the dormitory is supported by low
massive pillars; and the arches which spring from their capitals
form vaulted rooms, in which the family reside.&nbsp; There are
many beautiful features in this interesting ruin, to amply repay
the attention of the curious, and the research of the
antiquarian.&nbsp; The front seems to have been extensive, and
before it gurgles up a very pure spring of water.&nbsp; The
Abbot&rsquo;s apartments were contiguous to the church, and there
opened from one of them a small space, where he might stand, and
hear the holy services performed below.</p>
<p>The venerable ruin is lessened by every succeeding tenant, and
some of the recently erected buildings exhibit stones with
mutilated devices and inscriptions worked up in the walls.&nbsp;
In one of the farmer&rsquo;s bedchambers a stone forms part of a
chimney-piece, which is carved with running foliage, and contains
this imperfect inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Arvrvet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the only remain of any tomb discovered.&nbsp; In
digging a few months ago in the farm-yard, to make a drain, at a
short distance from the surface were dug up the remains of eleven
men, in a very small compass of ground, which goes far to prove
that this was the common cemetery of the Abbey; and also a
wedge-like stone, having carved on its front a hand, holding a
vine or olive branch, bearing fruit.&nbsp; The stone is now at
Plas Newydd.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>I have
in my account of Castell Dinas Bran recorded that Madog Ap
Gryffydd Maelor was buried in this Abbey, A.D. 1236; and his son,
Gryffydd Ap Madog Maelor, Lord of Dinas Bran, A.D. 1270.</p>
<p>Having thus given the best account I can of the present state
of this once noble Abbey, I now proceed to state what I can
collect from authentic sources of its Abbots and its
endowments.</p>
<p>Reyner, Bishop of St. Asaph, who died in 1224, bestowed on
this Abbey half the tithes of Wrexham.&nbsp; Abraham, his
brother, succeeded him in the Bishoprick in 1227, and gave the
remaining half. <a name="citation65a"></a><a href="#footnote65a"
class="citation">[65a]</a></p>
<p>Howel Ap Ednyfed, successor to Abraham, gave to it the Church
of Llangollen. <a name="citation65b"></a><a href="#footnote65b"
class="citation">[65b]</a>&nbsp; The monks also obtained, besides
these endowments, the patronage of several other livings, as
Wrexham, Ruabon, Chirk, Llansantffraid, and Llandegla.</p>
<p>The freemen of Llangollen made a grant in part of the river
near their town of a fishery to the monks of Valle Crucis; and,
for want of a seal of their own, affixed the seal of the founder
of the Abbey to the grant. <a name="citation65c"></a><a
href="#footnote65c" class="citation">[65c]</a></p>
<p>The landed endowments were, in the year 1291, near the Abbey,
a grange, with three ploughlands, <a name="citation65d"></a><a
href="#footnote65d" class="citation">[65d]</a> a mill, and other
conveniences, probably the donations of the founder Madog; the
granges of Bodhange, Tregam, <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Rudryn, and Baketon.&nbsp; I have no
means of ascertaining who were the donors of the farms, but I
find they had also the dairy farm of Nante; the grange of
Nostroyz, Convenet, and Grennychamt; also the grange of
Wyrcessam, consisting of one ploughland and some pasture, with
thirty cows, valued in those days at only thirty shillings.</p>
<p>All these estates were vested in the Abbot for the time being,
and formed no inconsiderable revenue; but the title of the monks
to several of the livings was disputed by a succeeding Bishop of
St. Asaph, called Y Brawd Du O Nannau, or the Black Brother of
Nanny, who obtained a decision in his favour.&nbsp; The third of
the tithes of Bryn Eglwys, or Egwestl, was, however, allotted to
them, in lieu of the patronage of Llandegla.</p>
<p>The monks had also a dispute with the freemen of Llangollen
respecting the fishery, the former having erected works on the
river, whereby they caught more fish than the Llangollen folks
thought came to their share, or than abstemious monks could
require.&nbsp; However, the affair was referred to the Prince of
Wales, and the fishery was confirmed to the Abbey in 1234.</p>
<p>I will now lay before my readers a short account of some of
the Abbots.</p>
<p>Dafydd Ap Ivan Iorwerth is highly celebrated by a bard in the
year 1480, who says of him, and of his successor, Ivan, or John,
that they lived in great splendour, that they had four courses
every day served on <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>bright silver dishes, and they drank claret,
&amp;c.&nbsp; He also commends the piety of the house, and says
that he was so happy as to be blessed by Abbot John, who had
three of his fingers covered with rings.&nbsp; The last Abbot was
John Herne, who received an annuity of 23<i>l.</i> per annum on
his surrender.&nbsp; In 1553 this annuity, and others to some of
the surviving monks, to the amount of 10<i>l</i>. 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> were the whole of the remaining charges. <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a></p>
<p>This is said to be the first Abbey that was dissolved in
Wales, and it remained in the crown until the ninth of James I.
who then granted it to Edward Wotton, created Lord Wotton.&nbsp;
In 1654, Margaret Wotton was in possession.&nbsp; She was a
recusant, and Cromwell then put it under sequestration to Edward
Davies, the Cneifwr Gl&acirc;s of Eglwyseg.</p>
<p>The last possessor, Mrs. Thomas, of Trevor Hall, built a kind
of summer-house at the back of the Abbey, adjoining to a pond
abounding with trout.&nbsp; Here was a charming field for the
display of taste; but, as in the hut at the top of Dinas Bran,
the opportunity has been lost.</p>
<p>Leaving the Abbey, let us now proceed through the adjoining
meadow to the Pillar of Eliseg, from which the valley takes its
name.</p>

But must give back its long committed dust<br />
Inviolate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pillar of Eliseg is supposed to be one of the oldest
inscribed British columns now existing, and is erected in a field
about three furlongs from the Abbey, standing in a delightful
valley, to which it gives the name of Valle Crucis, or the Vale
of the Cross.&nbsp; The spot on which it stands is a gentle
elevation, and is called Llwyn y Groes, i.e. the Grove of the
Cross.&nbsp; The pillar was twelve feet high, and inscribed all
round with letters.&nbsp; It stood in its place until some of
Cromwell&rsquo;s fanatical soldiers overthrew and broke it.</p>
<p>The pillar remained cast down many years, until Trevor Lloyd,
Esq. of Trevor Hall, reared its mutilated remains again into its
base, which had not been removed, and placed upon it this Latin
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span><span
class="GutSmall">QUOD HUJUS VETERIS MONUMENTI</span><br />

<span class="GutSmall">TANDEM RESTITUIT</span><br />

<span class="GutSmall">MDCCLXXIX.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;T. LLOYD, of Trevor Hall, at length, in the
year 1779, restored what remains of this ancient Monument, which
had been a long time removed from sight, and
neglected.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Cross, or Pillar, for it seems never to have had the form
of a Cross, is now little more than eight feet high.&nbsp; The
old inscription, which time has rendered illegible, has been
carefully copied by that great antiquarian, Mr. Edward Lloyd, <a
name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a> and informs us nearly of the time of
its erection, as under:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Concenn filius Cateli&mdash;Cateli <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a> filius Brockmail<br />
Brochmail filius Eliseg&mdash;Eliseg filius Cnoillaine<br />
Concenn itaque pronepos Eliseg edificavit hunc<br />
Lapidem proavo suo Eliseg.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of which the following seems to be an exact
translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Concenn, the son of Cateli; Cateli the son
of Brochmail;<br />
Brochmail, the son of Eliseg; Eliseg, the son of Cnoillaine;<br
/>
Concenn, therefore the great-grandson of Eliseg, erected<br />
This stone to his great-grandfather Eliseg.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>The
characters resemble one of the alphabets in use about the sixth
century, at which time this sepulchral pillar was erected.&nbsp;
Concenn and Eliseg probably resided at Castell Dinas Bran; and a
township adjacent bears the name of Eglwyseg, as well as the
stupendous and picturesque mass of rocks that range along the
vale, called the Eglwyseg Rocks, from Eliseg.&nbsp; Brochmail,
another of the persons mentioned, deserted the protection of the
Monks of Bangor at the battle of West Chester, when twelve
hundred of those unfortunate unarmed religious were cut to pieces
by the forces of Athelfrid or Edilfred, King of Northumberland,
A.D. 607. <a name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a></p>
<p>Brochmail, whom I suppose to be the same the Latins called
Brochmailus, was a great prince in that part of Britain called
Powisland, which was then very extensive, stretching from the
Severn to the Dee in a right line, from the end of Broxon Hills
to Salop, and comprehending all the country between the Wye and
Severn.&nbsp; He resided at Pengwern Powis, now Shrewsbury, <a
name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b"
class="citation">[70b]</a> in a house situated where the College
of St. Chad now stands.&nbsp; He was a great friend and favourer
of the Monks of Bangor, and took part with them against the
Saxons, instigated by Augustine the Monk to prosecute them with
fire and sword, because they would not agree to the forms and
ceremonies of the Church of Rome, and forsake their own
established customs. <a name="citation70c"></a><a
href="#footnote70c" class="citation">[70c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>I was
so fortunate as to meet with two persons who assisted in opening
the tumulus before the pillar was re-erected; and they gave me
the following accounts:&mdash;On digging below the flat pedestal
in which the base of the Pillar had been inserted, they came to a
layer of pebble stones; and after having removed them, to a large
flat slab, on which it seems the body had been laid, as they now
found the remains of it, guarded round with large flat blue
stones, and covered at the top with the same; the whole forming a
sort of stone box or coffin.&nbsp; The bones were entire, and of
very large dimensions.&nbsp; The skull and teeth, which were very
white and perfect, were particularly sound.&nbsp; My informants
said they believed the skull was sent to Trevor Hall, but it was
returned, and again deposited, with the rest of the bones, in its
former sepulchre.&nbsp; By this it should seem that Eliseg was
not an old man when he was buried here, and it is wonderful that
greater decomposition had not taken place in twelve hundred
years.</p>
<p>One of the persons who assisted at the exhumation is now a
very old man, and was huntsman to Mr. Lloyd when the tumulus was
opened.&nbsp; He says there was a large piece of silver coin
found in the coffin, which was kept; but that the skull was
gilded to preserve it, and was then again deposited with its
kindred bones.&nbsp; I asked if the bones were sound; and he
answered (I give his own words,) &ldquo;O, no, sir; they broke
like gingerbread.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>I have
now reached the limits I prescribed for myself on the north side
of the Dee, and trust I have noticed every thing most worthy of
attention.&nbsp; I purpose next to give a short account of the
river, and passing Llangollen Bridge, continue my route to
Glyndyfrdwy and Sycharth, once the residence of Owen Glyndwr.</p>
<h3>THE RIVER DEE.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On scenes like these the eye delights to
dwell,<br />
Here loud cascades, and there the silent dell;<br />
The lofty mountains, bleak and barren, rise,<br />
And spread their ample bosoms to the skies;<br />
While still the rushing river rolls along,<br />
The theme of many a humble shepherd&rsquo;s song,<br />
And as it rolls, the trout, in speckled pride,<br />
Springs playful in the smooth translucent tide.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The river Dee forms a beautiful and interesting feature in all
the most picturesque views around Llangollen.&nbsp; Passing from
Glyndyfrdwy down the river, it successively assumes the
appearance of the brawling brook over beds of pebbles; the deep
tranquil character of the gliding lake, reflecting on its pure
bosom the woods and mountains that surrounded it; the rushing
cascade or rapids, over beds of rocks, or through chasms of
stone.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;The current that with gentle murmur glides,<br />
Opposed by rocks impatiently doth rage;<br />
But when his fair course is not hindered,<br />
He makes sweet music with the enamelled stones,<br />
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br />
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;<br />
And so by many winding nooks he strays<br />
With willing sport to the wild ocean.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It rises a few miles beyond Bala, a town about twenty miles
from Llangollen, on the west, and runs through a pool now called
Bala pool, some say without mingling its stream. <a
name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"
class="citation">[73a]</a> There is no river in England which has
been so much celebrated by our poets for its sanctity as the Dee;
and Camden describes it as &ldquo;riseing on the east side of
Merionethshire, and forthwith passeth entire and whole through
Llyntegid, in English, Pimble Meare, or Plenlin Meare, <a
name="citation73b"></a><a href="#footnote73b"
class="citation">[73b]</a> a lake spreading far in length and
bredth; and so runneth out of it with as great a streame as it
entred in; for neither shal a man see in the Dee the fishes
called guiniad, which are peculiar to the Meare, nor yet Salmons
in the Meare, which neverthelesse are commonly taken in the
river.&rdquo; <a name="citation73c"></a><a href="#footnote73c"
class="citation">[73c]</a></p>
<p>The mazy windings of the Dee, embellished as its banks are
with the fresh green shrubs and plants, which flourish there in
great luxuriance, afford a very delightful walk, independent of
the great amusement to anglers for which this river has ever been
so famous.&nbsp; The trout <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>are as fine as any in the kingdom,
and are very plentiful.&nbsp; Many men obtain a livelihood during
the season, by fishing in this beautiful river, which they
contrive to manage in their little coracles; a large kind of
round basket, covered with skins or tarpawling, and with a board
across the centre for a seat.&nbsp; It is amusing to see them
waft themselves where they please, with a little paddle in one
hand, and a fly-rod in the other, fishing every corner of the
deep pool; and when tired, rowing to land, throwing their boats
on their shoulders, and walking with them to another deep pool,
where they again commence operations.</p>
<p>Salmon come up the river to spawn; and although so many do not
reach Llangollen as in former times, owing to the new inventions
erected on the river to entrap them in their way from the sea,
yet many of them overcome all impediments, and reach their usual
haunts.&nbsp; I saw last summer, at the season when the salmon
fray, or fry, seek their way to the sea from the river where they
have been bred, large shoals of these fish, and at one time more
than 40 fishing rods successfully employed in a small space of
water near the water-mill just above the bridge.&nbsp; This
fishery continued in great activity for many days; the bait used
being a common ground-worm, here called corbet.&nbsp; A little
fresh in the river at length came, of which the fish took
advantage, and proceeded on their way, after having lost some
thousands of their numbers at Llangollen.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>The
otter is found in this river, and, owing to the many fastnesses,
can seldom be destroyed.&nbsp; There are also numerous and
various aquatic birds.&nbsp; The rock-ousel, the kingfisher, the
sand-piper, the crane, and a duck-like bird, with black and white
plumeage, which the inhabitants term a cormorant, are very
common.</p>
<p>About a mile above the bridge is a deep chasm in the rocky
bed, through which the whole river, when not swollen,
rushes.&nbsp; It is six yards across, and bears the name of Llam
y Lleidr, i.e. Thief&rsquo;s Leap, from the circumstance of a
robber, who was pursued closely, having possessed sufficient
agility to clear this space, while his unfortunate pursuer fell
short, and was engulphed in the roaring torrent, narrowly
escaping the loss of life, as well as of property.&nbsp; There is
another chasm nearer the bridge, still deeper and narrower,
called the Cow&rsquo;s Leap.</p>
<p>The river runs over a bed of dark-coloured silicious rock,
which is sometimes got by the inhabitants for the use of
building.&nbsp; The bed of the river is consequently very uneven,
which causes it to foam and rush very impetuously along.</p>
<h3>THE BRIDGE</h3>
<p>Is a plain gothic structure at the west end of Llangollen, and
consists of four irregularly formed pointed arches, with
projecting angular buttresses.&nbsp; The bridge was built across
the Dee by John Trevor, Bishop of St. Asaph, and Chancellor of
Chester, A.D. 1346, and was <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>accounted one of the wonders of
Wales.&nbsp; The arches are of various dimensions; but the only
wonder I can discover seems to be the foundation, which is laid
upon the rock that forms the bed of the river, and is fastened
thereto with iron clamps.&nbsp; The bridge is built of hewn
stone, and is like most other old bridges, very narrow and
ill-paved.</p>
<p>Many wonderful tales are related of the sudden rise of this
river, and it certainly is a very inconstant stream; but I cannot
conceive it possible that the water should ever have risen, as
reported, so high as the base of the parapet.&nbsp; There is
another little bridge called the Chain Bridge, about two miles up
the river.</p>
<p>I will now cross the bridge to the south side of the
river.</p>
<h3>GLYN DYFRDWY.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They look&rsquo;d a manly, generous
generation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beards, shoulders, eyebrows, broad and square and
thick;<br />
Their accents firm, and loud in conversation;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their eyes and gestures eager, sharp, and
quick.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About five miles west of Llangollen, upon the road to Corwen,
and on the south side of the Dee, the way being enriched by such
varied and enchanting scenery as will amply repay the traveller
of taste for the fatigue of the excursion, is Glyn Dyfrdwy, once
the property and residence <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>of that famous chieftain Owen
Glyndwr, whose birth Shakspeare says marked him
extraordinary.&nbsp; I will, however, here give a short account
of his life, which I trust will prove entertaining to many of my
readers, and plainly show that &ldquo;he was not in the roll of
common men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Owen Ap Gruffydd Fychan, better known by the name of Owen
Glyndwr, <a name="citation77a"></a><a href="#footnote77a"
class="citation">[77a]</a> was descended from a younger son of
Gruffydd Ap Madog, Lord of Powis Bromfield, and of Dinas
Bran.&nbsp; He received his education in one of the inns of
court, and became a barrister-at-law.</p>
<p>It seems that about the year of our Lord 1395, he came into
great favour with King Richard II. who made him his scutifer, or
shield-bearer; <a name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a> and Owen was with the King when he was
surrendered to Henry, Duke of Lancaster, together with the Castle
of Flint. <a name="citation77c"></a><a href="#footnote77c"
class="citation">[77c]</a></p>
<p>Betwixt Owen and Reginald, Lord Grey, of Ruthin there arose a
fierce dispute, about a common lying between the Lordship of
Ruthin and Glyndyfrdwy, and belonging to Owen, who now assumed
the name of</p>
<p>Glyndwr; and who was held in great respect by his countrymen,
having artfully induced them to believe that he could &ldquo;call
spirits from the vasty deep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reginald was at first
conquered, and Owen possessed the disputed land; but after the
deposal and murder of King Richard in Pomfrest Castle, and Henry
had mounted the throne, <a name="citation77d"></a><a
href="#footnote77d" class="citation">[77d]</a> the scene was
changed; as Henry aided <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Lord Grey, who with his own vassals,
and assisted by some of the King&rsquo;s forces, again
dispossessed Owen of the land.&nbsp; Several severe encounters
took place between the rival chieftains; and although
Reginald&rsquo;s adherents were more numerous, the wily lawyer
was more fertile in expedients.</p>
<p>Owen, being apprised of an attack intended to be made upon him
by Lord Grey, here practised a successful ruse de guerre.&nbsp;
He erected a number of stakes in a bottom still called D&ocirc;l
Benig, <a name="citation78a"></a><a href="#footnote78a"
class="citation">[78a]</a> and having clad them in jackets and
Welch Caps, so alarmed Reginald by their appearance, that he gave
up the expedition.</p>
<p>At length Owen&rsquo;s good fortune and perseverance brought
his enemy into his power. <a name="citation78b"></a><a
href="#footnote78b" class="citation">[78b]</a>&nbsp; Having
artfully drawn Reginald from his strong hold of Ruthin, he caused
his horses to be shod backwards, which induced Reginald to
advance, supposing he was pursuing a flying enemy, when he fell
into an ambuscade, and was suddenly surrounded by Owen&rsquo;s
forces, and made prisoner.&nbsp; Owen then marched to Ruthin,
burnt the castle, destroyed the town, and despoiled the country.
<a name="citation78c"></a><a href="#footnote78c"
class="citation">[78c]</a></p>
<p>Prior to this success, Owen had laid his complaints before the
King&rsquo;s Parliament, and John Trevor, Bishop of St. Asaph,
and Chancellor of Chester, seeing that no <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>attention was
paid to his petition, after a long delay, ventured to expostulate
with the Lords, and to caution them that they did not, by
slighting or neglecting Owen&rsquo;s complaint, provoke the Welch
to insurrection.&nbsp; The reply of the Lords was full of
contempt, saying, &ldquo;They did not fear those rascally
bare-footed people.&rdquo; <a name="citation79a"></a><a
href="#footnote79a" class="citation">[79a]</a>&nbsp; It was
subsequent to this time that Glyndwr, finding his suit neglected,
resolved to endeavour to redress his own wrongs, which terminated
in the capture of Reginald, as before related.</p>
<p>This signal success drew to Owen many of his countrymen from
all parts of the principality, who urged him on, asserting that
the period was now arrived in which the prophecies of Merlin
would be fulfilled; and that he was the man through whose valour
the lost honour and liberties of their native country were to be
recovered.</p>
<p>Owen Glyndwr, smarting with resentment, and impelled by his
ambition, suffered himself to be persuaded to undertake the
emancipation of the principality; and in the mean time kept
Reginald Lord Grey a close prisoner; demanding ten thousand marks
for his ransom; six thousand to be paid on the feast of St.
Martin, in the fourth year of the King&rsquo;s reign, and
Reginald to deliver up his eldest son, with other persons of
quality, as hostages for the due performance. <a
name="citation79b"></a><a href="#footnote79b"
class="citation">[79b]</a></p>
<p>The King, at the humble suit of Lord Grey (he finding <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>no other
means for his enlargement,) appointed a council to treat with
Glyndwr, who stoutly refusing to recede from his terms, they
agreed to give him the sum demanded.&nbsp; It is also said that
Owen obliged Reginald to marry one of his daughters. <a
name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a"
class="citation">[80a]</a></p>
<p>Owen, being thus amply provided with money, and joined by
numbers of his countrymen, now flew at higher game, and boldly
attacked the Earl of March, who met him with a numerous body of
Herefordshire men.&nbsp; They came to close action, when the
Welchmen under Owen proved victorious, and the Earl of March was
taken prisoner, some accounts say by Owen himself in single
combat. <a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a>&nbsp; With his freedom he lost above
1,000 men, who were most savagely abused after they were
dead.</p>
<p>Edmund, Earl of March, whom Owen Glyndwr now held in thraldom,
was next in blood to Richard II. and therefore it was not
displeasing to King Henry that he should be thus kept out of the
way: nay, Camden says&mdash;&ldquo;He (Edmund) stood greatly
suspected to Henrie the Fourth, who had usurped the kingdome; and
by him was first exposed unto danger, insomuch as he was taken by
Owen Glyndwr, a rebell.&rdquo; <a name="citation80c"></a><a
href="#footnote80c" class="citation">[80c]</a>&nbsp; King Henry,
therefore, as might be supposed, turned a deaf ear to every
solicitation made on the Earl&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
<p>Now it was that Glyndwr, flushed with success, resolved <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>to assume the
title of Prince of Wales; and treating the King as a usurper of
the crown, and simply as Duke of Lancaster, he caused himself to
be proclaimed throughout the Principality.&nbsp; The better to
grace the matter, he feigned himself descended in the female line
from Llewellyn Ap Gruffyth, the last Prince.</p>
<p>His ambition now knew no bounds; and, by virtue of his new
title, he summoned a parliament at Machynlleth, in
Montgomeryshire, whither all the nobility and gentry of Wales
resorted.&nbsp; He kept his court at Sychnant, about seven miles
from Llangollen, on the road to Corwen.&nbsp; It is now
distinguished by a grove of firs, situated in a beautyfully
fertile country, and overlooking the Dee.&nbsp; A few scattered
stones are all that remain to mark the side where the palace of
Owen Glyndwr once stood, which his bard, Iolo Goch, sung was as
large as Westminster Abbey. <a name="citation81"></a><a
href="#footnote81" class="citation">[81]</a></p>
<p>About the middle of August, 1402, Henry, finding the power of
Owen Glyndwr increasing, and the turbulence of the Welch breaking
all bounds, resolved to crush their rebellion, and putting
himself at the head of a powerful army, marched into Wales.&nbsp;
But the very elements seemed to fight against him, the weather
proving <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>so
extraordinarily inclement that the King was obliged to make a
precipitate retreat, without accomplishing his intentions. <a
name="citation82a"></a><a href="#footnote82a"
class="citation">[82a]</a>&nbsp; The people attributed the
dreadful tempests which at that season occurred to the magic
power of Owen, who found it his interest to encourage their
credulity.</p>
<p>Edward Mortimer, perceiving the King had no intention of
opening his prison doors, and Glyndwr treating him with increased
gentleness and respect, fell into the scheme this artful and
politic man had devised.&nbsp; Owen Glyndwr <a
name="citation82b"></a><a href="#footnote82b"
class="citation">[82b]</a> was married to Margaret, the only
daughter of Sir David Hanmer, of Hanmer, in Flintshire (who was
one of the Justices of the King&rsquo;s Bench, and was knighted
by King Richard II.) by whom he had many children; and at this
time three of his daughters were unmarried, on one of whom the
captive Earl cast an eye of affection.&nbsp; Glyndwr at once saw
the advantage of this predilection, and proposed to league with
him against the King, and to cement this union by the marriage of
his daughter to the Earl.</p>
<p>To strengthen this league, and make the proposed insurrection
irresistible, the Earls of Worcester and Northumberland, two of
the most powerful Nobles in England, together with the Scottish
Chief Douglas, and Northumberland&rsquo;s valiant son of Henry
Percy, better known by the name of Hotspur, were invited to join
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>their
standards; and these rebellious Lords met at the house of Dafydd
Daran, the Archdeacon of Bangor, <a name="citation83a"></a><a
href="#footnote83a" class="citation">[83a]</a> and there signed
an indenture, sealing it with their own seals, to bind themselves
to assemble their forces, and join in putting down the King, and
for dividing the kingdom, vainly relying upon a foolish
prediction of Merlin, in which the King was depicted as an
execrable moldwarp, and Glyndwr and his colleagues as the wolf,
the lion, and the dragon, that were to pull the moldwarp down. <a
name="citation83b"></a><a href="#footnote83b"
class="citation">[83b]</a></p>
<p>This treaty, made with so much secrecy, and executed in the
recesses of Glyndwr&rsquo;s dominions, was soon communicated to
King Henry.&nbsp; Sir David Gam, so called because he had a
crooked eye, or squinted, or, as some say, had but one eye, was a
strong and faithful partizan of the Duke of Lancaster, now King
Henry IV. and consequently the inveterate enemy of Owen Glyndwr,
now Prince of Wales, at whose Parliament he attended, together
with the chief of the Welch nobles and gentry, but with very
different intentions; he having determined to put an end to
Glyndwr&rsquo;s rebellion with his life. <a
name="citation83c"></a><a href="#footnote83c"
class="citation">[83c]</a></p>
<p>David Gam was the son of Llewellyn Ap Howel Vaughn, a
gentleman of Brecknock.&nbsp; His scheme and his purpose were,
however, unfortunately for him, discovered and frustrated, and he
was immediately secured, and ordered by Owen for execution; <a
name="citation83d"></a><a href="#footnote83d"
class="citation">[83d]</a> but many of his <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>greatest
friends and adherents pleading for Gam&rsquo;s life, Owen thought
it politic then to stifle his resentment, and to grant him both
life and liberty, on his solemnly promising to continue in future
true and faithfully loyal to Glyndwr.</p>
<p>The promises of men in those days were frequently regarded
only so long as it suited their interests or convenience.&nbsp;
Such was the case with David Gam, who no sooner found himself
among his own friends, and in his own country, than he began to
assail and annoy all the favourers and adherents of Glyndwr, who
being soon apprised of the practices against him, and of the use
Sir David made of his liberty, marched with all expedition at the
head of a small body of his retainers, intending to make him
prisoner; <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a> but Sir David had the good fortune to
elude his vigilance, and escaped into England, where he lived for
the most part at court, not daring to visit his native country
until after the death of Owen Glyndwr.</p>
<p>Having thus missed his prey, Owen set no bounds to his
resentment.&nbsp; He burnt Gam&rsquo;s house to the ground,
wasted his substance, despoiled his tenants and friends, and by
the rigor of his proceedings so estranged the hearts of all, and
created so many enemies, that it was reasonable to expect that
through Sir David&rsquo;s means, or some of his emissaries, the
King would have information of what was plotting against him in
Wales.</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>Henry
at this time, fortunately, had a small army assembled for another
purpose; and no sooner was he apprised of this conspiracy against
him, than, placing himself at the head of his troops, he marched
them for Wales, to attack the confederates before they had time
to conjoin their forces. <a name="citation85a"></a><a
href="#footnote85a" class="citation">[85a]</a> Owen had not
collected all his strength, <a name="citation85b"></a><a
href="#footnote85b" class="citation">[85b]</a> and the Earl of
Northumberland, who was considered generalissimo, being seized
with a sudden illness, and confined to his bed at
Berwick-upon-Tweed, the King found the rebels under the command
of Hotspur at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The insurgent chiefs, seeing a battle inevitable, and knowing
that Glyndwr, with his hardy Welchmen, was in full march to join
them (in fact, he reached Oswestry at the head of 12,000 men on
the very day the battle was fought,) to gain time proposed a
conference, and drew up a list of grievances to be redressed; but
the matter ended in mutual recrimination, and both sides prepared
for battle.&nbsp; The numbers were nearly equal, about 12,000 on
each side, and the two armies were inflamed by the most dreadful
animosity.</p>
<p>The battle began with the most determined courage.&nbsp; The
King was seen every where animating his troops in the post of
danger, and he was most nobly seconded by his son, afterwards the
renowned Henry V. the conqueror of France.&nbsp; On the other
side the chieftains fought like <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>men accustomed to the bloody business
of war; and the battle was fierce, obstinate, and doubtful; when
the daring Hotspur, supporting the high character which he had
purchased by so many victories, and seeking a personal encounter
with the King, fell by an unknown hand.</p>
<p>The loss of their gallant leader was the loss of the
battle.&nbsp; The fortune of the King prevailed; and although on
that day no less than two thousand six hundred gentlemen, and six
thousand common men were slain, this victory served to confirm
Henry on his usurped throne, humbled the great Barons, and
restored peace to England.&nbsp; Had Owen Glyndwr at this
juncture pressed forward from Oswestry, where it has been before
said he was lying with a fresh army, and as numerous as the
English were before they had sustained so severe a loss, he might
have changed the aspect of affairs; but at this distance of time
a proper judgment cannot be formed.&nbsp; Some historians blame
him for his precipitate retreat into Wales, whither he was
followed by a part of the English army, under young Henry, who
made himself master of the Castle of Aberystwyth, which Owen
afterwards recaptured.</p>
<p>After this time Owen&rsquo;s fortunes appeared to decline, <a
name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86"
class="citation">[86]</a> and the fatal battle of Husk, fought on
the 15th of March, in which Glyndwr&rsquo;s son was taken, and
more than fifteen hundred of his men slain, seems to have sealed
his doom.&nbsp; <a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>But Glyndwr, although reduced, was not subdued, and he
continued a predatory and harassing warfare, most annoying and
destructive; sometimes making a sudden eruption into the marches,
and sometimes into the heart of the country; for now, the Welch
having submitted to the King, and being reconciled, Glyndwr
considered his countrymen his enemies.&nbsp; His skill in
devices, together with his local knowledge of the country, kept
the Principality in a dreadful state of fear and fermentation;
and although he eluded every effort made to entrap him, yet his
turbulent spirit drew upon his country the vengeance of the King,
in the most severe laws that were ever enacted against a
civilised people. <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a></p>
<p>Owen Glyndwr, once Prince of Wales, was now reduced to hide
himself in the caves and fastnesses of the country, to avoid the
pursuit of his enemies.&nbsp; He was <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>concealed and supported for some time
by Ednyfed Ap Aron, in a cave near the sea-side, at Llangelynin,
in Merionethshire, still called Ogof Owain. <a
name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a>&nbsp; The danger past, he again blazed
forth in the destruction of a territory he had once aspired to
govern; sometimes a fugitive, enduring hunger, thirst, and every
privation; at others revelling as a conqueror, on the spoils of
his countrymen and former friends.&nbsp; At last his depredations
became so general and so indiscriminate that he feared every one,
and became as &ldquo;a wild man, and his hand was against every
man, and every man&rsquo;s hand was against him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Being thus driven by his fears from solitary places, and at
length died for lack of sustenance. <a name="citation88b"></a><a
href="#footnote88b" class="citation">[88b]</a></p>
<p>Thus ignobly perished Owen Ap Gryffydd Fychan, commonly known
by the name of Owen Glyndwr&mdash;a man who, from trifling
causes, had conceived more determined hostility against the
English, and had conducted that hostility with more consummate
skill, than any other general the Welch had ever produced.&nbsp;
In his early career he was uniformly victorious: he was
proclaimed Prince of Wales with the sanction of the chief men of
the country, made alliances with princes, and exercised his
authority with becoming dignity; but now&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mighty victor, mighty Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Low on his funeral couch he lies;<br />
No pitying heart, no eye t&rsquo; afford<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tear to grace his obsequies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Owen
Glyndwr was one of those fiery meteors which Providence sometimes
permits to visit the earth, for the instruction of mankind, and
to show us the vanity of all sublunary things: astonishing the
world with their splendour, they blaze for a short time; and as
suddenly decline, and sink into obscurity.&nbsp; Such, in our own
horizon, have been Glyndwr and Cromwell, and in later times
Bonaparte.&nbsp; Their course was brilliant, but short; and as
their greatness grew, so did their suspicions and their fears;
until, at last, life itself became burdensome, and the end of
their career was clouded by disappointment, misery, and
despair.</p>
<p>But Owen Glyndwr had more legitimate reasons to plead than
either of his compeers.&nbsp; Deprived of a part of his patrimony
by power, and unable to obtain redress by law, he took the law
into his own hands, and had recourse to force.&nbsp; Success
produced ambition, which proved his overthrow.</p>
<p>Owen was bold, wary, and revengeful: he set no bounds to his
resentment.&nbsp; He made a smoking ruin of the dwelling of his
countryman, Sir David Gam, and thereby made him an implacable
enemy.&nbsp; He was the cause of the loss of one hundred thousand
lives, <a name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a> and of the destruction of immense
property.&nbsp; Many houses and other buildings were burnt and
destroyed by him; among which I find enumerated the Castle of
Ruthin, the Cathedral <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>of St. Asaph, the Cathedral of
Bangor, the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace, &amp;c. at Llantaff, the towns
of Leominster and Old Radnor, besides the house of Sir David Gam,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>It will be right to notice that Mr. Pennant gives the
following account of the death of Owen Glyndwr; but as he states
there is nothing confirmatory of Owen&rsquo;s interment at
Monnington, I have thought it right to adhere to the older
authorities:&mdash;&ldquo;He matched his daughters,&rdquo; says
Mr. Pennant, &ldquo;into considerable families: his eldest,
Isabel, to Adam Ap Iorwerth Ddu; his second, Elizabeth, or as
some say, Alicia, to Sir John Scudamore, of Ewyas, and Home Lacy,
in Herefordshire; Jane he forced upon Lord Grey De Ruthin; and
his youngest daughter, Margaret, to Roger Monnington, of
Monnington, in Herefordshire, at whose house some accounts say he
died, and was buried in the church-yard there.&rdquo; <a
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a></p>
<p>The prison where Owen confined his captives, and of which some
remains may still be seen, was near the church at Llansantffraid
Glyndyfrdwy; and the place is still called Carchardy Owen
Glyndwr.&nbsp; He is said to have died in the sixty-first year of
his age.</p>
<p>I trust it will be deemed a pardonable digression, if I now
give the sequel of the military career of that loyal and truly
brave Welchman, Sir David Gam.&nbsp; I have before recounted that
Glyndwr forced him to fly for protection to the court of England,
where he continued <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>in favour with King Henry IV. until the death of that
monarch.&nbsp; I then find him accompanying his son, King Henry
V. on his expedition into France, in the year of our Lord 1415,
at the head and in the command of a numerous body of stout and
valiant Welchmen, who on all occasions distinguished themselves
by their courage and conduct. <a name="citation91"></a><a
href="#footnote91" class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>To Sir David Gam was assigned the important office of
reconnoitring the French army, on the approach of the famous
battle of Agincourt.&nbsp; Finding the French nearly ten times
more numerous than the English army, he replied to the
King&rsquo;s question as to the enemy&rsquo;s
strength&mdash;&ldquo;An&rsquo;t please you, my Liege, they are
enough to be killed, enough to run away, and enough to be taken
prisoners.&rdquo;&nbsp; The King was well pleased with such an
answer from a man of Sir David&rsquo;s valour.</p>
<p>In the battle which followed, and which was fought on the 25th
of October, 1415, the King alighted from his horse to head his
footmen, and to encourage them to resist the charge of the second
line of the French army, then advancing; when eighteen French
cavaliers, who had bound themselves by an oath to kill King
Henry, or perish, rushed upon him in a body, and one of them with
a blow of his battle-axe so stunned the King that he would have
fallen an easy victim, had not Sir David Gam, with his
son-in-law, Roger Vaughn, and his kinsman, <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Walter Llwyd,
of Brecknock, seasonably sprung to his rescue.&nbsp; They slew
fourteen of the assailants, and delivered the King, when they
fell at his feet, covered with wounds.&nbsp; In the heat of the
battle, Henry was separated from his brave defenders; but being
soon afterwards informed that their wounds were mortal, he
immediately repaired to the spot where Sir David and his faithful
companions lay; and, as the only recompense in his power then to
bestow, he knighted them all three upon the field, where they
soon after died. <a name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a></p>
<p>Thus ended the life of Sir David Gam; but the remembrance of
his loyalty, and the fame of his valour, will live, and
perpetuate his memory.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So sleep the brave, who sink to rest,<br />
By all their country&rsquo;s wishes bless&rsquo;d,<br />
When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,<br />
Returns to deck their hallow&rsquo;d mould,<br />
She there shall dress a sweeter sod<br />
Than Fancy&rsquo;s feet have ever trod.<br />
By fairy hands their knell is rung,<br />
By forms unseen their dirge is sung.<br />
There Honour comes, a pilgrim grey,<br />
To bless the turf that wraps their clay;<br />
And Freedom shall awhile repair,<br />
To dwell a weeping hermit there.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is conjectured that Shakspeare took Sir David as a
specimen, when he wrote the character of Captain Fluellen, in
Henry V.</p>

beautiful level road, made at the expense of Government, with the
Berwyn Mountains rising abruptly on the right hand, and the
murmuring Dee pursuing its devious course on the left, I pass a
small brook, which divides the counties of Merioneth and
Denbigh.&nbsp; A pillar on the top of the mountain above is for
the same purpose.&nbsp; The views over the Dee are incomparably
charming.</p>
<h3>LLANGOLLEN CHURCH.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hail, ancient edifice; thine aisle
along,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In contemplation wrapt, now let me stray;<br />
And stealing from the idly busy throng,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Devoutly meditate the moral lay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Llangollen Church, which stands in the middle of the town, is
a low gothic structure; and the south side appears the most
ancient part of the edifice.&nbsp; At the east end, on the
outside wall, are two knees, which seem to have been intended as
the spring of an arch, for an enlargement of the building.&nbsp;
The roof is slated, and there is a tower steeple at the west end,
containing four bells and a clock, with quarter chimes.</p>
<p>The Church is dedicated to Saint Collen Ap Gwynnawg, Ap
Clydawg, Ap Cowdra, Ap Caradog Freichfras, <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Ap Lleyr
Merim, Ap Einion Yrth, Ap Cunedda Wledig, by Ethni Wyddeles,
daughter of Matholwch, Lord of Cwl, in the kingdom of Ireland; <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a> which saint was buried here.&nbsp; In
the Church was formerly a recumbent figure in alabaster, vulgarly
called Saint Collen.&nbsp; The unshapely remains of this monument
are still to be seen in the belfry, where it has been thrown.</p>
<p>The roof of the Church is supported with three massive stone
octagon Doric pillars, of great antiquity, and two heavy
abutments.&nbsp; The roof itself is very curiously enriched with
carved compartments, in old oak, supported by figures of angels,
in various attitudes, also of solid oak.&nbsp; These figures and
the roof I suspect to be spoils of the Abbey Crucis, to which the
Church of Llangollen was incumbent.&nbsp; The transom beams that
support the roof are indented with tracery; and on the north side
of the beam over the north aisle, is the following very curious
inscription cut in old letter.&nbsp; It is so lofty that it can
scarcely be made out distinctly, but I have taken some pains to
give it correctly:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Y nav i ti, Mair, vydd barod bob
awr.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Heaven for thee, Mary, will be open every
hour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have little doubt that this beam, as well as the other <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>decorations
of the roof of the Church, was brought from Llan Egwest, which it
will be recollected was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful half-length of our Saviour in the window
over the altar, painted upon glass by Eginton, of Birmingham,
with this inscription under it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nid fy ewyllys i, ond yr eiddo ti a
wneler.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">S. Lau pen. 22, ad. 42.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my will, but thine be done.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe there are no other Welch inscriptions in the Church,
among the many grave stones, tablets, &amp;c. which abound; and
yet service is performed in no other language, except on the
second sabbath in every month, and on Good Friday.&nbsp; There
are many English families now resident in Llangollen and its
neighbourhood; and to those that are seriously disposed this is a
great privation.</p>
<p>The Church is well served by the very worthy and pious Vicar,
who resides at the Vicarage; yet, notwithstanding, there are four
dissenting congregations in the town, viz.&mdash;Wesleyan
Methodists, Whitfield or Calvinistic Methodists, Independents,
and Baptists.</p>
<p>In the church-yard is a school, under which is a vestry-room,
bearing this inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;This school-house was
built at the expense of the parishioners, having obtained the
ordinary license, with consent of the Rev. R. Price, vicar,
1773.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>The
customs of the orthodox Welch Church are similar to those in
England, except in the following, viz.&mdash;that of bedecking
the graves of the dead with shrubs and flowers; of singing before
the corpse to the church; and the very annoying one of ringing a
passing bell in the following manner:&mdash;On the day prior to
the funeral the bells are tolled in a very quick succession of
strokes; that is to say, twelve quick strokes on the first bell,
and after a short pause, twelve on the second; and so on once
round, the number of strokes on each bell, denoting the condition
of the deceased.&nbsp; Thus, twelve strokes on each bell denotes
the death of a married master of a family; eleven strokes the
mother or mistress of a family; ten strokes an unmarried or young
man; nine a young woman unmarried; six a boy; and five a
girl.&nbsp; Then begins an incessant monotonous toll of the great
bell, in minute time, which generally continues all that day
until eight o&rsquo;clock at night: it commences again at eight
o&rsquo;clock on the following morning, and does not cease until
eight o&rsquo;clock at night, except during the time of
interment.&nbsp; The usage at the burial is also novel to an
English observer.&nbsp; When the service in the church is
concluded, the officiating minister goes to the steps of the
altar, whereon a sort of wooden plate is previously placed; and
the attendants and friends of the deceased immediately proceed to
deposit money thereon in his presence, which is instead of
dues.&nbsp; When the corpse is consigned to the earth, the clerk
receives the donations <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>of the people that are around the
grave, upon the spade with which he is throwing the earth upon
the coffin; and this is his share of the fees.</p>
<p>There is also an old and curious custom observed at Christmas,
called Plygan, or Plygain, that is, &ldquo;the time of night when
the cock croweth; the morning twilight.&rdquo;&mdash;On the
morning of Christmas Day, the bells are rung as is usual to
assemble to church, about four o&rsquo;clock; and on their
ringing about six o&rsquo;clock, most of the parishioners
assemble, some bringing candles, and the church is also lighted
up.&nbsp; After the prayers (morning service for the day) are
read, the congregation continue, and the minister also, hearing
original carols in the Welch language, on our Saviour&rsquo;s
nativity.&nbsp; This time and custom were formerly much more
seriously observed, when men believed</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That ever &rsquo;gainst that season
comes<br />
Wherein our Saviour&rsquo;s birth is celebrated,<br />
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;<br />
And then they say no spirit walks abroad;<br />
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike;<br />
No fairy takes, no witch hath power to charm;<br />
So hallowed and so gracious is the time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Except two or three marble monuments in the Church, there are
no other remarkable objects; but in the church-yard are many very
neat and handsome freestone tombs.&nbsp; Some of those recently
erected are in the sarcophagus form, and are very nicely
executed.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite the south door of the Church stands <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>a triangular
gothic column of freestone, surrounded by a light iron railing,
erected over the grave of a highly respected domestic of the
Right Hon. Lady E. Butler, and the Hon. Miss Ponsonby.&nbsp; The
pillar is executed in good taste, and on one of the three facades
are the following lines, doing much honour to the heart as well
as to the head of the composer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">In Memory of<br />
Mrs. MARY CAROL,<br />
Deceased the 22nd of November, 1809,<br />
This Monument is erected,<br />
By Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby,<br />
Of Plas Newydd, in this Parish.</p>
<p>Released from earth, and all its transient woes,<br />
She whose remains beneath this stone repose,<br />
Steadfast in faith, resign&rsquo;d her parting breath,<br />
Look&rsquo;d up with Christian zeal, and smiled in death;<br />
Patient, industrious, faithful, gen&rsquo;rous, kind,<br />
Her conduct left the proudest far behind;<br />
Her virtues dignified her humble birth,<br />
And raised her mind beyond this sordid earth.<br />
Attachment, sacred bond of grateful breasts,<br />
Extinguish&rsquo;d but with life this tomb attests,<br />
Rear&rsquo;d by two friends, who will her loss bemoan,<br />
Till with her ashes here shall rest their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poor of Llangollen have much reason to pray that period
may be far distant; for the benevolence of these retired ladies
is extensive and discriminate; and it may justly be said there is
not a poor deserving object in this little town, who does not
participate in their bounty.&nbsp; I shall conclude with a brief
notice of their residence.</p>
<h3><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>PLAS
NEWYDD.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis pleasant through the loopholes
of retreat<br />
To peep at the great world&mdash;to see the stir<br />
Of the great Babel, and not feel the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plas Newydd, situated at the east end of the town of
Llangollen, has long been the residence of two eminently
distinguished ladies, the Right Hon. Lady Eleanor Butler and the
Hon. Miss Ponsonby, <a name="citation99"></a><a
href="#footnote99" class="citation">[99]</a> who came to
Llangollen, and after a time purchased the domain, and planted
and decorated the grounds.&nbsp; It has attained its present
beauty under their own superintendence.</p>
<p>Many years have elapsed since these ladies withdrew from the
world, to which, from their rank and accomplishments, they would
have been distinguished ornaments, and secluded themselves in
this beautiful retreat, where they have uniformly been the
benefactresses of the poor, the encouragers of the industrious,
and the friends of all in their neighbourhood.&nbsp; The peculiar
taste and beauty with which these noble and highly distinguished
ladies have decorated and adorned both the exterior and the
interior of their far-famed retreat, exites universal <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>admiration
from the first characters and families, who are continually
visiting them.</p>
<p>A palisade, ornamented with antique and grotesque figures,
carved in oak, encloses the front, before which a profusion of
the choicest flowers and shrubs is tastefully arranged.&nbsp; The
entrance and the windows, which are formed after the manner of
ancient religious houses, are decorated with carving in the same
material.&nbsp; The entrance-door is unique, and a great
curiosity, being beautifully ornamented with well polished carved
figures; the whole of which are of black oak, and kept
particularly bright, giving the retreat a very uncommon
appearance.&nbsp; The entrance-hall, stairs, and passages, are
chastely in character; and the windows are ornamented with
painted glass in the most appropriate manner.</p>
<p>The gardens, in which nature and art are judiciously united,
are extensive, and display much taste.&nbsp; The thick and
umbrageous foliage of the lofty forest trees, that occupy a part
of the lawn and gardens, is the safe asylum of numerous birds,
which in this calm seclusion revel unmolested.&nbsp; A pair of
beautiful wood-owls have found a safe and quiet shelter in the
trunk of an old ivy-covered tree; and on a lawn a little further,
is erected a pretty moss-covered alcove, furnished with a few
well-selected books: it is nearly in the centre of the garden,
and is open in front.&nbsp; The confidence of the birds is shown
by some of them every year building their nests in this recess:
indeed, these airy inhabitants appear to be quite <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>tame and
familiarized by the kindness of their amiable protectors.&nbsp; I
believe the birds have much the larger portion of the produce of
these beautiful gardens, as none of them are suffered to be
molested.</p>
<p>Through the lower part of the shrubbery, a brook, called
Cyflymen, i.e. Speedy, murmurs over its pebbly bed, and is
crossed by a rustic bridge, which leads to a bank covered with
lichens, and furnished with appropriate seats, near which rises a
pure fountain, whose waters are as clear as the crystal glasses
which ornament its margin: in short, the beauty of the scenery,
aided by a little enthusiam, might inspire the idea that</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Here in cool grot and mossy cell,<br />
The rural fays and fairies dwell:<br />
Though rarely seen by mortal eye,<br />
When the pale moon, ascending high,<br />
Darts through yon limes her quiv&rsquo;ring beams,<br />
They frisk it near these crystal streams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carved stone brought from the Abbey Crucis, and mentioned
as being dug up at the time the bodies were discovered, stands
near the entrance.</p>
<p>I have thus completed the circuit I proposed at the
commencement of my labours.&nbsp; To hope the attainment of
perfection in a work of this nature would with justice be deemed
presumptuous; but I trust any inaccuracy will be treated with
lenity, and that due allowance will be made for the disadvantage
under which verbal information is at all times collected by a
person who does not <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>understand the native
language.&nbsp; Thus far I can with truth say, that, from a
desire to combine correctness with intelligence, I have in no
case given that on heresay, which might be readily ascertained by
ocular demonstration.</p>
<p>With regard to the quotations which I have thought proper to
introduce, I must here again draw upon the kind indulgence of my
readers.&nbsp; Not having an extensive library at my command, I
have sometimes been obliged to quote from memory.&nbsp; This will
also, in some degree, account for omissions of which I may in
places be deemed guilty.</p>
<p>I will now take leave of my friends, assuring them that, if I
have not done all I might for their information and amusement, it
must be attributed to any other cause rather than a want of
desire and endeavour on my part.&nbsp; It would, indeed, be
unpardonable in me to deserve such an imputation, after having
received so many marks of attention from friends whom I have had
occasion more than once to consult in the progress of my
researches, and being furnished with information from quarters
where I had not the least claim.</p>

rebellious practices of Glyndwr so exasperated King Henry against
the Welch people, that he enacted laws which in effect took away
all their liberties.&nbsp; They were rendered incapable of
purchasing any lands, or of being elected Members of any county
or borough; or of undertaking any office civil or military in any
town incorporate.&nbsp; No Englishman could be convicted of any
crime against a Welchman, but by an English judge and jury.&nbsp;
An Englishman, by marrying a Welch woman, was deprived of all his
privileges as an English subject.&nbsp; No Welchman could possess
any castle or place of defence, or be supplied with victuals or
armour, without a warrant from the King or from his Common
Council.&nbsp; And further it was enacted that no Welchman should
be capable of undertaking the office of Justice, Chamberlain,
Sheriff, or other place of trust, in any part of Wales;
notwithstanding any patent or license heretofore given to the
contrary.&nbsp; With other rigorous and unjust laws, forbidding
any Welchman from bringing up his children to learning, or
binding them to any trade or occupation.&nbsp; Henry V. at his
succession repealed these abominable laws.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
